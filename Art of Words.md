The Art of Words is a homebrew subclass of Bard, which channels the Magic Words and the [[Concept of Connection]] to imbue magical commands into his speech, affecting his environment and creatures around him in various ways. The Art of Words was discovered by a reasonably unknown family of poets, which uses [[Truecommon]] to universally place magic into spoken words, without regarding the language of the speaker.

This class, similar to the Bard of the Siren, uses the voice as a spellcasting focus.
