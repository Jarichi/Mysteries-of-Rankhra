# Description
The Makhshar Desert is a gigantic, seemingly infinitely stretching plain of sand and dunes, but can be separated into several specific landmarks.
## Landmark 1 - Grand Desert Plains
The largest portion of the desert is divided into the Grand Desert Plains, consisting mostly of sandy dunes and large swats of sand. The plains also serve as the space between the more diverse landmarks and act as a canvas on which the desert painted its features. The harsh conditions forced creatures and flora to adapt to a more subsurface level and cactus-like appearance. A nomadic and traveling tribe dwells these areas and hunts the rare and hidden creatures that live here.
## Landmark 2 - Phiaro Basin
The Phiaro Basin is a specific portion of the desert near the [[Phiaro Channel]] (as the name suggests). This landmark is a vast, open space which looks like a crater. The basin is rocky and solid. A village nearby protects the unique ecosystem that lives in the basin by hunting any and all foreign creatures.
## Landmark 3 - Cornucopia Streak
The Cornucopia Streak is the home of the city. This oasis contains many different species and provides a diverse and unique area in the desert. The hunt group living in this area hunts the rarer and more violent/valuable creatures living here.
## Landmark 5 - Shifting Plains
The ever-changing dunescape of the Shifting Plains contains a mysterious city rumoured to modify its appearance every single day. A hunting group that consists of only Changelings and Shifters lives here and hunts the strange creatures living among the dunes.
