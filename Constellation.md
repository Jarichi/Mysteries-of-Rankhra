A constellation is a collective nown of describing a network of communication between Comets, which is sustained by an [[Asteroid]].
Originally pitched by the Shoka Engineering Collective, the first constellation - in service of the city - was created by [[The Sandy Sandwich]] to provide the city with a daily newspaper and supplement communication.

In the mean time, multiple different sub-constellations have been created for different purposes.
