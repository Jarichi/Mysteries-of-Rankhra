BBEG for the first arc. (maybe)

Rubae is a for now, too powerful spellcaster to be dealt with, and is responsible for the subtle sabotage and planting the idea that the concepts are actually evil, for a hidden agenda. This character is most likely connected to Cynthia's character lore.

She might join a bit later in the campaign due to personal issues

warlock vampire
	sorta a daywalker, maybe getting the artifact is a way to overcome the weakening effect of the sun


on her appearance, Rubae is completely unrecognisable and will be represented as a "strong magical force" or something. She blows up Frederic and attempts to leave, yadda yadda the rest of the session planning.
She tortured Frederic to get the information out of him, before killing him, and the party intercepted this


vampires have a bad rep

maybe on low health, she turns into a vampire-like creature again and needs to find blood or something to return to "normal"
throne of Glass, iron witch
