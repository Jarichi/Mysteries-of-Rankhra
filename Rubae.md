BBEG for the first arc.

Rubai is a for now, too powerfil spellcaster to be dealt with, and is responsible for the subtle sabotage and planting the idea that the concepts are actially evil, for a hidden agenda. This character is most likely connected to Cynthia's character lore.

She might join a bit later in the campaign due to personal issues

warlock vampire
	sorta a daywalker, maybe getting the artifact is a way to overcome the weakening effect of the sun


on her appearance, Rubae is cxompletely unrecognisable and will be represented as a "strong magical force" or somethign. She blows up Frederic and attempts to leave, yadda yadda the rest of the session planning.
