Currently thinking about how to integrate this with the lore I currently have. Below are some notes 
### What I like
- Small families of Simics that have been specially trained by a power, to fulfill certain tasks
- Familiy Drama and traumatic backstory
- Reason for leaving this world and setting out upon the world.
- Interesting premise
#### Expansions
- Expand on WHY these families are being suppressed specifically
- Expand on how these overlords came to be
- Expand on what Ratronus left behind
### What can be changed
- Overlords see themselves as holy. DOes this mean that they operate singularily, or are still being controlled or influenced by the other crime groups in the campaign?
	- By extension, why are they not really being handled and are allowed to run rampant like this?
- Character doesn't currently have a certain specific goal
- Timebase for how long specifically this has been going on
