## Creation
After the Fall of the God of Creation and before the creation of the Concepts, the first few pieces of their soul created the gods [[Crafted Life]] and Gentle Death, which govern the most important law of nature: Life and Death.
Gentle Death vowed to be with everyone who crossed over to the other world, opposite of Crafted Life, who vowed to only be with the people blessed enough to shape their own future (player characters). To help lessen the burden and impact of death, they allowed for any creature that died, to change or trigger a small event and thus have one final impact on the world they leave behind.

note: I do need to rethink combat if I want to grant this to *ALL* creatures that die, since any enemy can just trigger some warning or reinforcement thing if they die and such completely fuck over any and all stealth or lack-of-info missions... hmm
