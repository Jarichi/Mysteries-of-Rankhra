Concept of Growth:
- this manifests itself in plant growth, and literal tall creatures
- But also self growth
- the city in which this concept resides is very spiritual an citizens spent most of their time meditating and connecting to other planes of existance
- the city can be situated on the highest mountain, symbolizing **growth**
	- may also jsut be a massive tree lmao
- gwowing population
- but also growing expenses
- growing ideas -> city of developement -> lots of creaatively minded people who want to grow


plotpoint: needs to be kept in control since evergrowing city is obviously not good for the city -> mission for the party.
