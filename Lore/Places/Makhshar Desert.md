# Description
The Makhshar Desert Is a gigantic, seemingly infinitely stretching plain of sand and dunes, but can be separated into several specific landmarks.
## Landmark 1 - Grand Desert Plains
The largest portion of the desert is divided into the Grand Desert Plains, consisting mostly of sandy dunes and large swats of sand. The plains also serve as the space between the more diverse landmarks and act as filler. There is not a lot of vegetation or life in these parts, most animals live underground and most plants resemble cacti species.
## Landmark 2 - Phiaro Basin
The Phiaro Basin is a specific portion of the desert near the [[Phiaro Channel]] (as the name suggests), caused by a collapse into the underground portion of the desert. The Phiaro Basin originally formed Phiaro Lake, which served as the original source of the Phiaro Channel. The basin is quite hard and rocky, with a crater in the centre.
## Landmark 3 - Makhshar Caves
The Makhshar caves are a ginormous cave complex
## Landmark 4 - Cornucopia Streak
The Cornucopia Streak is where the [[Zal'Aata]] is located. Due to the presence of the Concept of Growth and the Concept of Flow, this area contains loads of vegetation and life, and as such is a prime living location for [[Animal]].
