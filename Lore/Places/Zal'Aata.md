#City 
## Origin
Ancient texts and legends speak of a mysterious temple of unclear origins. This temple is said to provide the city with life and vitality and mysteriously provides a limitless supply of water within certain bounds. Within these limits, the city [[Zal'Aata]] was founded, making use of the mysterious powers of the temple - dubbed Rankhra by its citizens, signifying the life-giving properties of the temple - and developing into a stable and prosperous metropolis, brimming with people and community.

Zal'Aata was founded about 500 years or so, and as such is a relatively young. Starting out as a simple farming settlement making use of the temple's resources, Zal'Aata quickly grew to a sizeable metropolis. The city has been a major part in the production of flax and hemp which aided its development into the industrial steampunk age. This also boosted the economy and as such turned it into a major export trade centre. Considering Zal'Aata is relatively close to [[TradeRiver]], this allowed for sea trading to happen easily. Generally throughout the city, a steady burst of magical energy can be detected, coming from the temple itself. This aided the religious groups in their story writing and may be regarded as a possible explanation for divine influence.

## Structure

The city is divided into several sections that also divide the wealth classes, as seen in [[zal aata.jpg]]. These sections also have general dedicated neighbourhoods that contain, for example, mostly a certain race of people or a certain school of trade. These divisions are further outlined below.
### [[Central Square]] - Temple area (name WIP)
The ruling class and elite classes live near the temple, benefitting from its magical influence that increases their lifespan by slightly slowing down the flow of time due to the magical spells housed within Rankhra. The central square is not divided in several neighbourhoods, instead being a union between races. The governing body of Zal'Aata is located near the temple as well.
### [[First Domain]] - Circle around temple area (name also WIP)
The middle class and most shop owners live slightly more distant from the temple and as such don't benefit much from the time dilation given by the temple. This region contains most standard shops and most luxury shops, as well as the Bazaar. Most magical and non-magical education is also located within this ring, though basic education is also around.During the day, the people generally remain inside and don't really go out due to the desert heat. As such, most specialised shops are closed during the day. In order to accommodate tourists and outsiders, standard shops are indeed opened during the day since most visitors are not accustomed to an inverted day cycle.
### [[Second Domain]] - Outside premises near the city walls
The lower class and most research groups are located within the outside premises of the city. This mostly contains common races like Fiends and Humans. While having lesser shops and stores, the wares that are being sold here are more exclusive and unique. This provides an uniwue shopping experience. During the day, most people avoid the sun and as such have created covered passageways using fabric sheets. This creates a darkened and slightly gloomy atmosphere. At night, most inhabitants leave this area and head towards the First Domain to indulge in the bruising night life of the city. Most travellers also live within these premises to allow for a quick and easy way of resting before setting out into the desert.

Several resarch groups are also located within this domain.
### [[Third Domain]] - Underneath the city
The city canals go below ground to act as irrigation and sewage, but in turn also house the really poor people and criminal organisations
