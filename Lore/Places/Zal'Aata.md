#City 
## Basic Info
### Etymology
The name Zal'Aata comes from somewhere.
### Origin and general information
Ancient texts and legends speak of a mysterious temple, shrouded in the mists of time and whispered to be the wellspring of life itself. This enigmatic landmark mysteriously provides a limitless supply of water within certain bounds. Within these limits, the city [[Zal'Aata]] was founded, making use of the mysterious powers of the temple - dubbed [[Rankhra]] by its denizens, signifying the life-giving properties of the temple - and developing into a stable and prosperous metropolis, brimming with people and community.

Founded around 500 years ago, Zal'Aata quickly evolved from a humble farming settlement to a bustling metropolis, harnessing the mystical powers of Rankhra. The city has been a major part in the production of flax and hemp which aided its development into the industrial steampunk age. This also boosted the economy and as such turned it into a major export trade centre. Considering Zal'Aata is relatively close to the [[Phiaro Channel]], this allowed for sea trading to happen easily. Generally throughout the city, a steady burst of magical energy can be detected, coming from the temple itself. This aided the religious groups in their story writing and may be regarded as a possible explanation for divine influence.

Due to the relentless desert heat, the denizens of Zal'Aata adapted to a nocturnal lifestyle. The city's architecture, designed with this in mind, allowed for a harmonious blend of both day and night activities, with intricate canal systems enabling the sustenance of life in the arid environment. Due to the heavy light pollution caused by nocturnal lifestyle, the mages of the city crafted an artificial magical [[Sky Dome]] to simulate stars and the noight skye.
## History
Some five centuries past, a modest farming settlement took root on the arid soil surrounding a mysterious temple known as Rankhra. The enigmatic sanctuary, a source of life-giving waters within defined bounds, bestowed upon the settlers an unspoken promise of prosperity, which was haughtily made use of by the farmers. Recognising the need for protection against the intense desert sun, they began farming crops useful for the creation of fabrics and ropes, namely flax, to protect themselves against the intense desert sun by way of shade.
When more discoveries were made, the village shifted its focus on developing suitable ways of generating energy. Due to the presence of unlimited water flow, they could use water mills for milling flax, for example. 
The strategic proximity near the [[Phiaro Channel]] allows for maritime trade routes, furthering Zal'Aata's influence on the world. 
## Structure

Zal'Aata is a city divided into distinct domains, each reflecting the social and economic stratification of its populace.![[zal'aata.jpg]]These domains encompass dedicated neighbourhoods, catering to specific races and trades, contributing to the city's diverse tapestry.
### [[Centroscopia]] - Temple area
At the heart of Zal'Aata lies Centroscopia, the temple area, where the ruling and elite classes reside. Cloaked in the magical aura of Rankhra, this region benefits from a slowed passage of time, extending the lifespans of its fortunate denizens. The central square serves as a melting pot of races, and it houses the city's governing body. Exclusive places of worship for various religious groups surround the temple, adding to the spiritual aura.
### [[First Domain]] - Circle around temple area
Slightly removed from the temple's influence, the First Domain accommodates the middle class, shop owners, and educational institutions of varying levels. Standard and luxury shops, the bustling Bazaar, and magical academies coalesce in this ring.
Most specialised shops are closed during the day. In order to accommodate tourists and outsiders, standard shops are opened during the day since most visitors are not accustomed to a nocturnal rhythm. When the day breaks, most people either remain shrouded in darkness or explore the outside of the city.
### [[Second Domain]] - Outside premises near the city walls
The Second Domain, situated outside the city walls, hosts the lower class, research groups, and unique shops. An opportunity to practice religious beliefs is also provided.
This domain accommodates diverse races like Fiends and Humans, fostering a distinct atmosphere.
Despite the reduced rate of stores, the wares that are being sold here are more exclusive and unique. This provides an unique shopping experience for most city folk.
The most notable feature of the Second Domain is the large amount of fabric canopies spanned above the smaller passageways. This curious feature was spawned from tradition to honour the founders of the city, but also serves a practical purpose. Due to the lack of above-ground canals to cool this domain, the canopies still provide a suitable way of cooling down by simply blocking the sunlight.
Nighttime witnesses a migration towards the First Domain, where the city comes alive with bustling activity.
### [[Third Domain]] - Underneath the city
Beneath the city's surface, the canal system not only serves as irrigation and sewage but also harbours the destitute and secretive criminal organizations. The Third Domain, hidden from the sun's harsh gaze, becomes a refuge for the city's poor. Meanwhile, shadowy figures in the criminal underworld maneuver in the subterranean labyrinth, weaving a web of intrigue and intelligence networks that influences the city's delicate balance.
