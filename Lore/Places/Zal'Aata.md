#City 
Ancient texts and legends speak of a mysterious temple of unclear origins. This temple is said to provide the city with life and vitality and mysteriously provides a limitless supply of water within certain bounds. Within these limits, the city [[Zal'Aata]] was founded, making use of the mysterious powers of the temple - dubbed [[Rankhra]] by its citizens, signifying the life-giving properties of the temple - and developing into a stable and prosperous metropolis, brimming with people and community.

Zal'Aata was founded about 500 years or so, and as such is relatively young. Starting out as a simple farming settlement making use of the temple's resources, Zal'Aata quickly grew to a sizeable metropolis. The city has been a major part in the production of flax and hemp which aided its developement into the industrial steampunk age. This also boosted the economy and as such turned it into a major export.trade centrer. Considering Zal'Aata is relatively close to [[TradeRiver]], this allowed for sea trading to happen.
Generally throughout the city, a steady burst of magical energy van be detected, coming from the temple itself.

The city is divided into sections reminiscent of Babylon as seen in [[zal aata.jpg]]. The elite and holy leaders live near the temple and as such live slightly longer than the middle class and lower class. 

The middle class mainly lives in the second ring section around the temple with isolated neighbourhoods in the outer section. THis is also where most expensive shops and such are located. The central market is also located here, although this is more like a market strip near the canals.

The city canals act as both the irrigation as well as the sewage system, and go below ground. This is also where part of the lower class lives and where the more clandestine and underground part is located.

The lower class mainly lives within the outer section. More intrresting and unique shops are located here, like artifact stores and curiosa. The shops are slightly bordering the line between middle and lower class in order to attempt to boost sales and draw customers.
