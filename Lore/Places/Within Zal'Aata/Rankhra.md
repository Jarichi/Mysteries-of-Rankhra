## Origin Mythos
 It is said that this temple was a gift from the heavens from one of the many deities residing in this plane and they inspired the ancient civillisation of [[Ancients]], who built the temple in their name. Legends speak of residents of this ancient civilisation still dwelling inside of the temple. However, this tale cannot be confirmed due to a powerful magical barrier preventing anyone from accessing the temple.
 Mysteriously, this temple seems to infinitely dispel water directly from inside, flowing outward and into the cardinal directions of the temple base, and as such became the center point of [[Zal'Aata]].

## History

## Properties


In the centuries after the city was founded, several research groups have attempted to breach the magical barriers of Rankhra with limited success. Instead, they focused on studying the architecture and construction of Rankhra, as well as researching its past and examining the nature of its magic. Religious groups have also claimed the temple to be built by an ancient civilisation worshipping either a singular God or several deities, and spread their respective gospel.

Within the temple barriers, mysterious spells have been weaved which slow down the flow of time by a large factor, preventing the temple from decaying. While most of the magic is lept inside by its powerful barriers, a small amount of it leaks directly outside the barriers, causing the civilians living near it to age at a slower rate.

Within the temple, several activatable portals are located leading to different planes of existence. The temple also contains a fast travel way to the [[Side Temple]].
