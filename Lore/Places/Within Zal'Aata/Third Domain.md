The Third Domain is an overlooked part of Zal'Aata that houses may diverse groups and, while being a place where evrybody may belong, very muxh includes criminals in this description.

It houses many different criminal organisations, most of which are led by one/multiple central cartels. It also contains the [[IntelligenceAgency]], which is a network of technically-not-illegal spies and the lot. This may simlpy be seen as a powerful criminal organisation were it not for the fact that the city backs them.

# Appearance

Bricks and lots of neon signage
## Lifestyle
Inhabitants of the Third Domain are generally poor but can make a living within the Third Domain. Most people don't tend to travel outwards but stay within here.
