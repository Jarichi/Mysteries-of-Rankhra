## Origin Mythos
 It is said that this temple was a gift from the heavens from one of the many deities residing in this plane and they inspired the ancient civillisation of [[Ancients]]. 
 
Mysterious temple protected by a magical force field that prevents anyone from entering it. Located at the centre of [[Zal'Aata]]. This temple is built by the [[Ancients]]

In the centuries after the city was founded, several research groups have attempted to breach the magical barriers of Rankhra with limited success. Instead, they focused on studying the architecture and construction of Rankhra, as well as researching its past and examining the nature of its magic. Religious groups have also claimed the temple to be built by an ancient civilisation worshipping either a singular God or several deities, and spread their respective gospel.

Within the temple barriers, mysterious spells have been weaved which slow down the flow of time by a large factor. While most of the magic is lept inside by its powerful barriers, a small amount of it leaks directly outside the barriers, causing the civilians living near it to age at a slower rate.

Within the temple, several activatable portals are located leading to different planes of existence. The temple also contains a fast travel way to the [[Side Temple]].
