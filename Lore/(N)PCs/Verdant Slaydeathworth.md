Leader of the [[ResearchGroup]]. Either has ties to the underworld or has lots of contacts that allow them to easily deal with getting rid of other people. While fighting for a good cause, their alignment can be described as chaotic good perhaps; willing to do whatever it takes to reach their goal.

Verdant Slaydeathworth is a summer Eladrin warlock with a particular connection to the beginnings of Zal'Aata (perhaps some forefather was the original founder of Zal'Aata) and a particular drive to uncover the secrets of Rankhra. They have an impressive posture and are quite powerful, and are very passionate for [[ResearchGroup]], willing to go far - perhaps too far - to achieve their goal of uncovering the secrets of Zal'Aata.

Verdant has connections throughout the country, making them a powerful ally and a dangerous foe who you should not get on the bad side of. However, since they have to be the leader of the research group, they have since learned that the best way for people to respect and trust you is to deliver a consistent performance and put yourself out there.

They can be described as a charismatic and intense person, willing to stand up for what they believe in. They are a passionate person who puts reaching their goals above the resources they used, as long as it gets reached. This can come across as insensitive, but Verdant deeply cares about their allies. Since they are an Eladrin, they are able to see the beauty within every person. They have assumed the Summer Eladrin form to better lead their group.

Personality trait and flaw: You stand tall and strong so that others can lean on you. The best option is one that is swift, unexpected, and overwhelming.
