Leader of the [[ResearchGroup]]. Either has ties to the underworld or has lots of contacts that allow them to easily deal with getting rid of other people. While fighting for a good cause, their alignment can be described as chaotic good perhaps; willing to do whatever it takes to reach their goal.

Verdant Slaydeathworth is a summer Eladrin warlock with a particular connection to the beginnings of Zal'Aata (perhaps some forefather was the original founder of Zal'Aata) and a particular drive to uncover the secrets of Rankhra. They have an impressive posture and are quite powerful, and are very passionate for [[ResearchGroup]], willing to go far - perhaps too far - to achieve their goal of uncovering the secrets of Zal'Aata. Their patron is an Archfey.

## History
### Birth and childhood
Verdant was born in the Feywild, their parents being a member of the [[Feywild Merchants]], more specifically being a subgroup called the [[Nomadic Feywild Collective]]. Being raised in a plane-hopping culture, they always felt a connection to both the Mortal Plane and the Feywild. They often accompanied their parents on their various trips throughout the world, always trading and never lingering in one spot, though they always returned to the Cornucopia Streak (and its Feywild alternative). Initially believing that this was simply due to a preference, Verdant did not pay this much mind.

After a number of centuries of trading and travelling, they eventually decided to look more into the culture of the mortal plane and read about Zal'Aata. They found out that the city was founded due to the presence of a mysterious temple, which had been built by the [[Ancients]]. Feeling that there must be more to this story they decided to investigate this more closely and eventually discovered that one of the significant spellcasters who were responsible for the construction of the temple turned out to be one of their ancestors. This prompted them to split off from the Nomadic Feywild Collective and move to Zal'Aata in the hopes of uncovering more about the temple.

note: they might have made a bonds with some archfey to provide them with the nessecary resources to travel freely between the planes.

inspiration note: they might have heard about some magical artefact hidden within the temple, or might have been tasked to find this by the NFC.
### Creation of the Research Group
After moving to the city, they were initially surprised seeing that the city was way more active during night-time. After a small adjustment, they managed to purchase a small, tucked away cafe in the Second Domain that was only accessible through the sewers and through a small alleyway. Noticing some activity within the sewers, they left to explore. Before leaving, they enchanted the alleyway with Fey magic that erased the memories of passerbies and sent a message to Verdant who passed through here.

[entered the Third Domain, met their partner, started the research group, managed contacts all throughout the city, and is now giving missions to other people.]
After moving to the city, they first got accustomed to the nocturnal lifestyle and quickly made friends with other cityfolk. These people were prominent members of the INtelligence GRoup, Criminal Organisation and city elite and ensured that Verdant got plenty of reputation..
Of course, they wanted to create a research group. In order to more successful do this, they made sure to lay groundwork for connections across Zal'Aata to ensure a steady stream of information. They also looked into the previrous work of the various research groups that have also researched Rankhra.

Verdant has connections throughout the country, making them a powerful ally and a dangerous foe who you should not get on the bad side of. However, since they have to be the leader of the research group, they have since learned that the best way for people to respect and trust you is to deliver a consistent performance and put yourself out there.
## Personality
They can be described as a charismatic and intense person, willing to stand up for what they believe in. They are a passionate person who puts reaching their goals above the resources they used, as long as it gets reached. This can come across as insensitive, but Verdant deeply cares about their allies. Since they are an Eladrin, they are able to see the beauty within every person. They have assumed the Summer Eladrin form to better lead their group.

Personality trait and flaw: You stand tall and strong so that others can lean on you. The best option is one that is swift, unexpected, and overwhelming.
