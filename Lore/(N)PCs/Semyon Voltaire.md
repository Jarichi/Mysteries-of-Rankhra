Semyon Voltaire is a human (?) wizard who specialises in the school of divination. He is the current leader of [[IntelligenceAgency]] and mostly operates outside of the public view. Despinte not irignially being from the city, he possesses a large amount of knowledge on everything going on within the city, going as far back as its beginnings. He is [[Verdant Slaydeathworth]]'s partner in both senses of the word, and currently lives within the [[Third Domain]].
## History
### Birth and Childhood
Growing up in the [[City of Change]], he had an ever-changing sense of identity. 

After either leaving or fleeing the City of Change, he wandered through the desert looking for a place to stay, which he found in Zal'Aata. At this time, he took on the identity of a human wizard but... hmmm

I dont want him to be of high descent, so He did not enter the first or second domain, and I think I want him to kind of enter the third domain where he learned what he knows now. I don't really know how I want to write him further tho. Might need to look into this later... He is a changeling tho, who took on the form of a human and ascended to leader of the agency. He obv came from the ciry of change which he fled for reasons, and ended up in zal aata. He probably wasnt as successful in his career which caused him to go to the 3rd domain. here, he was more successful due to what the 3rd means. (in the sense that information has avlue and money doesnt exist). He mightve been an elusive criminal once, who eventually got caught by the former leader of the agency and got enlisted.

I kind of wanna make him a mysterious character, both morally and appearance-wise. I also haven't written a single tragic backstory yet so it's about time.
