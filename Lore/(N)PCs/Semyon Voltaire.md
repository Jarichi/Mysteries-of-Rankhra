Semyon Voltaire is a human (?) wizard who specialises in the school of divination. He is the current leader of [[IntelligenceAgency]] and mostly operates outside of the public view. Despite not orignially being from the city, he possesses a large amount of knowledge on everything going on within the city, going as far back as its beginnings. He is [[Verdant Slaydeathworth]]'s partner in both senses of the word, and currently lives within the [[Third Domain]].
## History
### Birth and Childhood
Growing up in the [[City of Change]], it was not to be expected to have any form of constant identity. The ever-changing inhabitants and the ever-shifting city encouraged change, but Semyon never felt fully at ease amidst the chaos. He yearned for a more constant self-image, a more constant identity. He ultimately made the difficult decision to leave his home and embark on a journey of self-discovery.
Wandering the desert eventually brought him to Zal'Aata. Hoping that this city would give him a chance to become his own person, he attempted to enter the city, but was rejected at the gate due to his appearance as a changeling. Semyon was perplexed but saw this as an opportunity to finally assume a more definite form, and decided to assume the form of an ordinary human, and as such made his way into the city.
### Arrival in the City
Semyon, however, hadn't planned for the fact that you needed to have credentials and despite his intrinsic ability for magic was not allowed to work any entry-level jobs that would allow him to make a living. This forced him into poverty and made him look for a better way of living.
This lead him to the city's Third Domain, where (as far as he knew) the poor and homeless reside. He decided to take a shot and entered the Third Domain. Luckily, money was of no use here and since he was from the City of Change, this information allowed him to get a simple home and food and stuff.

Realising that this information was only worth so much, he made the beginnings of his own personal growth plan and attempted to land a job at the [[IntelligenceAgency]]. (lack of inspiration so drafting stuff atm). He used his skills as a changeling (masters of disguise) and divinity magic to gather information and work his way up in the ranks of the agency. Eventually, his employer died under suspicious sircumstances and he assumed this role, making him the leader of the agency.

This is when he found out about Verdant and observed them, and interlinks with their backstory.

I dont want him to be of high descent, so He did not enter the first or second domain, and I think I want him to kind of enter the third domain where he learned what he knows now. I don't really know how I want to write him further tho. Might need to look into this later... He is a changeling tho, who took on the form of a human and ascended to leader of the agency. He obv came from the ciry of change which he fled for reasons, and ended up in zal aata. He probably wasnt as successful in his career which caused him to go to the 3rd domain. here, he was more successful due to what the 3rd means. (in the sense that information has avlue and money doesnt exist). He mightve been an elusive criminal once, who eventually got caught by the former leader of the agency and got enlisted.

I kind of wanna make him a mysterious character, both morally and appearance-wise. I also haven't written a single tragic backstory yet so it's about time.
