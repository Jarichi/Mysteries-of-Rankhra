Founded not long ago, [[ResearchGroup]] was created by [[Nameless Slaydeathworth]], in the hops of going beyond what other groups have achieved.

# Description
Not long ago, Rankhradventurers was founded by [[Nameless Slaydeathworth]], in the hopes of continuing on the foundational work of older research groups by using the recent developments in technology and utilising the diverse skillset of its leader. Members are assigned missions to either retrieve more information on business related to Rankhra, or control information on Rankhra.

# Organisation and Management
## Management
The group is lead by a single leader and their partner, who each manage different parts of the organisation. This partner mainly deals with resource management and mainly acts as the frontman of the group, while the leader deals with more subtle and background matters. For example, the partner introduces the missions and does the research, while the leader mainly focuses on ensuring that the mission results are correctly handled, not shying away from more... clandestine matters.

## Membership
Members of the group are entitled to a variable pay based on mission difficulty, with a minimum of 50 gold per person. Members also have access to the [[Hotel]], where they are provided with free housing and breakfast.

# Goals
wants ot improve and solve the information and such that is available about Rankhra, and wants to go where no group has gone before.
# Political landscape
Since Rankhradventurers is a relatively new group, but with a relatively influential leader, they have a solid footing with regards to the rest of Zal'Aata. However, due to their leader, they are also discreetly being investaigated by the [[IntelligenceAgency]].
