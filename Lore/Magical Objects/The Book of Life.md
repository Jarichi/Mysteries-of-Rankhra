Magical book that, every minute while reading, it deals 1d10(?) necro damage.

# description
While reading, this book will describe the entire life of the person currently in possession of the item. Every chapter will note down a significant event of the reader and contains a 1st person novel-like story. The story contains the absolute truth of the character, and the second-to-last chapter contains the most recent events (including a sentence of "I am reading a book about a person reading a book about a person reading a book...", repeating indefinitely and preventing a user from looking at the future pages.) This may be bypassed if magical trickery is used to perceive the contents of the pages beyond without actually turning the pages, allowing them to see their future, but as a cost dealing considerably more damage after one minute.

While reading the book, it slowly drains the readers life force energy to fuel the book's energy, and deals 1d10 necrotic damage every minute without exception. If the reader dies while reading, their life energy gets fully absorbed and the final chapter of the Book of Life can be read, containing lore about [[Gentle Death]].
