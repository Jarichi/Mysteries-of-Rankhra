Alchemists are generally divided into two groups
## Alchemy Students
They basically have a business course given by the [[Great Acadamy of Arcane Arts]], the student group that sells the most potions with the most potent effects win like extra credits. This lends itself to lots of bulk dropshippers with shit effects but lots of cheap, and specialised students that don't have many potions and are proced reasoably expensively, however are more potent.

## Professional Alchemists
Graduating from this part of the magic school allows you to sell your potions under the banner of a professional alchemist
