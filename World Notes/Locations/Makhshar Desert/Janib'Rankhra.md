## Description
The place where [[Aki]] ended up after arriving in the mortal realm through the portal, and also the cause of the portal. This is obviously connected with the [[World Notes/Lore/Ancients]].
After dropping from the Feywild and praying to the Fey, she was sent to the city to possibly find a way back to the Feywild
### Entymology
Literally means "Side'Rankhra".
