## Description
The first domain is the historical centre of Zal'Aata. It houses a variety of different shops and townsfolk, and houses most higher-end infrastructure. It also houses the [[Great Acadamy of Arcane Arts]]. Moat notably, however, the First Domain acts as the first impression tourists and travellers have of Zal'Aata, and has the [[Bazaar]] - A ginormous market along the cardinal directions with a large variety of wares and trading.
