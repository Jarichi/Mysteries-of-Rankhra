The Feywild Traders is a small but enterprising merchant group inside Foxglove Grove.

At the helm of this intrepid group stand Alden and Elara. Alden, a seasoned adventurer hailing from the mortal realm, possesses a discerning eye for rare and valuable artifacts, his keen intellect and shrewd negotiation skills making him a formidable presence in the bustling markets of the Feywild. Complementing his human counterpart with grace and cunning is his friend Elara, a Kitsune whose intimate knowledge of the Feywild's labyrinthine pathways and hidden enclaves has proven invaluable in navigating the perilous landscapes that lie beyond Foxglove Grove.
Together, Alden and Elara form a formidable team, their symbiotic partnership epitomizing the spirit of cooperation and camaraderie that defines the Feywild Traders.

After gathering trinkets within the enchanting depths of the Feywild, Alden returns to the mortal realm, accompanied by Elara, who discreetly assumes her fox form perched on his shoulder.
This guise not only shields her true identity from the prying eyes of outsiders but also allows her to swiftly navigate through unfamiliar terrain, evading potential dangers that lurk beyond the mystical realm's borders.
