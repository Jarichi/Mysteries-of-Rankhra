Vast sandscape which is mainly empty, but contains the [[Badawi Hunter Tribe]]

# Description
The Makhshar Desert is a gigantic, seemingly infinitely stretching plain of sand and dunes, but can be separated into several specific landmarks. It is quite cold at night but reasonably hot during the day. As such, most travel occurs at dawn and dusk. 
## Landmark 1 - Grand Desert Plains
The largest portion of the desert is divided into the Grand Desert Plains, consisting mostly of sandy dunes and large swats of sand. The plains also serve as the space between the more diverse landmarks and act as a canvas on which the desert painted its features. The harsh conditions forced creatures and flora to adapt to a more subsurface level and cactus-like appearance. When travelling through this part of the desert, travellers must account for exhaustion and must be adequately prepared.
## Landmark 2 - Phiaro Basin
The Phiaro Basin is a specific portion of the desert near the [[Phiaro Channel]] (as the name suggests), caused by a collapse into the underground portion of the desert. The Phiaro Basin originally formed Phiaro Lake, which served as the original source of the Phiaro Channel. The lake eventually dried up and caused the vast open crater-like space that now forms the Phiaro Basin.
The basin is quite hard and rocky, with a crater in the centre. What remains of the Phiaro Lake can be found within the very centre of the basin.
## Landmark 3 - Makhshar Caves
The Makhshar caves are a ginormous cave complex spanning a wide portion of the desert and possessing many mysteries. The cooler temperature allowed for critters and vegetation to take on more mesmerising and -quite literally- radiant forms by means of bio-luminescence. The caves contain an ancient stronghold overrun by some creature and contains many secrets and hidden knowledge.
## Landmark 4 - Cornucopia Streak
Assisted by the Concept of Growth and the Concept of Flow, the Cornucopia Streak is the home of [[Zal'Aata]]. This oasis contains many different species and provides a diverse and unique area in the desert. The Concept of Flow ensures plenty of water for all vegetaation and creatures, and the Concept of Growth makes for increased Most importantly, [[Auroch]] have found their home here.
## Landmark 5 - Shifting Plains
The ever-changing dunescape of the Shifting Plains contains a mysterious city rumoured to modify its appearance every single day (hint: see graph view) [[City of Change]]. (honestly the most interesting part of the desert imo). 

## More landmarks are WIP
