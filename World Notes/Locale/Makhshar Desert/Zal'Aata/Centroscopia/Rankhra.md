### Etymology
The name Rankhra is a derivation of the words 'Ankh' and 'Ra', signifying Life and Sun/Beginning
## Origin Mythos
 It is said that this temple was a gift from the heavens from one of the many deities residing in this plane and they inspired the ancient civilisation of [[Ancients]], who built the temple in their name. Legends speak of residents of this ancient civilisation still dwelling inside of the temple. However, this tale cannot be confirmed due to a powerful magical barrier preventing anyone from accessing the temple.
 Mysteriously, this temple seems to infinitely dispel water directly from inside, flowing outward and into the cardinal directions of the temple base, and as such became the center point of [[Zal'Aata]].
The temple has been built on one of the sites where the God of Creation dispelled themselves, and the [[Concept of Flow]] lies. This causes the infinite flow of water, but also the altered flow of time.

Note: temple was made by [this](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:temple-of-the-gods) spell.

## Layout
### Outside
Outside of the temple is a regular temple ground with some channels with water and generic temple stuff
Inside of the temple contains an ancient garden containing odd [[flowers]] from a time long forgotten. One of these flowers is [[Foxglove]], a drug origination from the feywild.

It also contains an altar assigned to the God of Creation, it contains an ancient library containing information on old things, (which might be used in character lore) and contains a hallway towards the main temple room.
### Inside
The main temple room is a giant altar that contains a strange object, representing the Concept of Flow, and a strangely dead-ended hallway, leading to a secret room containing a mysterious [[hidden book|book]] and an unusable ancient scroll of the spell used to create the temple. The main temple room also contains a fast-travel portal to [[Janib'Rankhra]].

## Properties
In the centuries after the city was founded, several research groups have attempted to breach the magical barriers of Rankhra with limited success. Instead, they focused on studying the architecture and construction of Rankhra, as well as researching its past and examining the nature of its magic. Religious groups have also claimed the temple to be built by an ancient civilisation worshipping either a singular God or several deities, and spread their respective gospel.

Within the temple barriers, mysterious magic slows down the flow of time by a large factor, preventing the temple from decaying. While most of the magic is kept inside by its powerful barriers, a small amount of it leaks directly outside the barriers, causing the civilians living near it to age at a slower rate.

Further properties are determined by that spell.
