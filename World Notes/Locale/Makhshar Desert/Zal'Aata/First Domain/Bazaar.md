The Bazaar is a hectometre-long daily market that sells pretty much everything from general items to unique artifacts. While partially run by Zal'Aatas ruling class, its contents are determined by the residents of the First and Second Domains.

The Bazaar is active 24/7. During the day, it sells more generic travel items and standard loot and during the night it sells more unique items and travellers gear at a lower price. 

It's also a major tourist attraction from travelers who came from the Phiaro Channel; these also provide the market with its unique loadout, and provide a way for the Bazaar to export goods as well. the [[Hunter Settlement]] sells their valuables here as well.
