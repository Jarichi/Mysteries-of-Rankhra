The Third Domain is an overlooked part of Zal'Aata that houses may diverse groups and, while being a place where evrybody may belong, very muxh includes criminals in this description.

It houses many different criminal organisations, most of which are led by one/multiple central cartels. It also contains the [[F.I.Z.]], which is a network of technically-not-illegal spies and the lot. This may simlpy be seen as a powerful criminal organisation were it not for the fact that the city backs them.
# History
When the city was created, this domain did not exist yet, despite the sewers being locally accessible. It was not after the economy of Zal'Aata began to thrive before a wage gap was created that forced the poor and homeless to find a place to stay. They decided to settle within the sewer system below Zal'Aata, where money held no real value and they created a more interesting system of trading; information.

Realising that information held value, they detached themselves from the economy altogether causing them to be poor on paper but rich in other things, and allowing for the ones without possessions to still have an opportunity to build themselves up. As a consequence, this trade for information made it easy for more clandestine networks to exist and gather information.

Certain businesses traded information for real money and as such allowed for materials to still be bought and used in construction, leading to a prominent neon signage and cyberpunk-y style.

# Appearance

Bricks and lots of neon signage
## Lifestyle
Inhabitants of the Third Domain are generally poor but can make a living within the Third Domain. Most people don't tend to travel outwards but stay within here.
