#npc 
The second runaway informant of the [[ResearchGroup]]. He left because he was fed up with Verdant and learned about some crucial and valuable information. He gave in to his greed and decided to go no-contact with the research group. After this, he fled to the Third Domain and decided to join one of the Big Groups that Also Have To Do with Joris' Backstory. The value of the information he has enabled him to advance to the position of Overlord. He has no  plans to return to the research group.
I guess I can make this guy one of the smaller BBEGs in the campaign for now.

### Quest
After receiving the whereabouts from Salina, the research group can find Marcus with relative ease since he did not put in any effort to properly hide his trails from anyone within the Third Domain. Upon arriving at a large and slightly ominous building, Joris needs to roll history with advantage to see if he recognises this building as one of the Overlord buildings.
When the party enters this building, they feel like they're being watched in secret and will eventually enter a large open room with a throne in the middle.

Marcus, sitting on this throne, will talk about how he already expected Verdant to send their minions after him and will make clear that he is not scared at all, since he has now ascended towards godhood (as per Joris' backstory) and no longer needs them.
He will also make clear that he has no plans to share the information he has to anyone since that is what enabled him to become who he is.
[[Marcus vs. Party|Combat]] ensues and Marcus + a number of minions will attack the party.
If the party kills Marcus, the letter instructs them to bring his body to Verdant for special treatment. If the party doesn't kill Marcus, they can obviously take him to Verdant.

#### Information
Marcus learned that Rankhra contains the Concept of Flow and knows some super important information that alloed him to be taken seriously by the Cool Bandit Group.

In order to ascend to Overlord, he found out that Verdant and Semyon are in some sort of relationship together, that Semyon is the current leader of the Intelligence Agency and some more details about Verdant and Semyon that I still need to come up with.
