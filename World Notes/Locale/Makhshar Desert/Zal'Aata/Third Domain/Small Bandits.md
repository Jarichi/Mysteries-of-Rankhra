The Small Bandits are a collection of minor groups that just do their own thing and indiscriminately attacks targets within the Third and Second domain. They are just causing a ruckus everywhere and aren't anything serious for now.

All smaller groups have a symbol that is based on the symbol for the Large Criminal Organisation. Most of them run hideouts and such.

Minor band names are based on mushrooms (thanks jaiumy)

these will serve as random encounters that may or may not be a larger plot hook
