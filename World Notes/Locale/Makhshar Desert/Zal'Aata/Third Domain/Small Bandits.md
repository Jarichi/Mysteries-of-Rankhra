The Small Bandits are a collection of minor groups that just do their own thing and indiscriminately attacks targets within the Third and Second domain. They are just causing a ruckus everywhere and aren't anything serious for now.

All smaller groups have a symbol that is based on the symbol for the Large Criminal Organisation. Most of them run hideouts and such.
