An auroch is a beast-like, large cow creature with very large horns. They generally only graze desert plants but occasionally hunt for smaller animals.

### General Living area
The main auroch group lives near th eoasis, but when they go hunting, they 'branch' out to the Cornucopia streak to forage and hunt for smaller animals.
##### Strengths and weaknesses
- strengths
High amount of base strength, and not susceptible to pushing, moving and grappling attacks.
High speed
Typically live in packs
- weaknesses
Long horns make for an easier wrangle target (fulcrum principle)
Large body makes for lower dexterity; when it is charging, it cannot easily change direction.
	opportunity for taunting
when separated from their group, they generally are more aggressive and less careful
