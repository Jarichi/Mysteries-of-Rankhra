The Badawi  Hunter Settlement is a mysterious group of legendary hunters who are rumoured to have singlehandedly wiped out the population of "animal" after receiving numerous reports from the vcarious cities in the Makhshar desert that they were causing problems.

This act, among others has given the Gida an air of mystique and spurred many legends. The most noteable, however, is that they are presumed to posses the Concept of Exploration. While nobody knows exactly what eactly is this Concept, it is the cause for the Giza to continuously move their settlement around the desert in a seemingly random path.

The research group would like to know more about the concept of exploration and wants to send the group on an easier mission.
