#group 
[[Hunter]] was part of this group. They have a signature symbol or something. Base of ops is withing [[Badawi Hunter Settlement]].  They have been known for following some sort of [[Bahath Animal Guide]], who is the Concept of Exploration

The tribe is not lead by anybody and exists as an anarchist body. It mainly takes care of its own benefits and does not allow outsiders to enter without accompaniment of one of the members. The tribe only talks to its members, and visitors need to direct their questions to the guide in order to talk to them

The tribe does not know about any Concept ideas, however they know that they NEED to keep the animal alive.

The tribe also contains a travelling merchant who sells potions at an increased price to visitors

Basically, this tribe is very closed-off and not at all used to visitors. It's also kinda xenophobic hehehe

if you stay near the tribe as a member, your memories are intact but if you leave the tribe your memories of this tribe get wiped since you are no longer exploring the path of exploration but your own path
	in-lore explanation for the fact that Hunter doesnt remember anything about this area and also an in-lore explanation that there is no knowledge about this tribe ojutsifdde of the tribe itself.
