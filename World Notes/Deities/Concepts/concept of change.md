The concept is a person. This changes everytime :3

The Concept of Change is contained within [[../../Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/City of Change/Yataghatay]], where it remains bounded. Represented as a different creature at a specific time interval (probably a few days), the Concept of Change directly influences Yataghatay. During each period, the city exhibits a certain theme, where all inhabitants speak a certain language, are dressed in a certain style and behave a certain way. So far, no pattern has repeated itself, yet styles may be combined.
Scholars are investigating whether these styles may be prophetic in nature, however, no conclusive evidence has been raised.

It is represented by the Song of Shifting, as described in the [[Concepts of Creation]]. This Song also influences the current theme of the city, and if someone were to know the entire song (impossible, since this would go against the very nature of change), they could predict these themes.

The Concept is closely linked to [[../../Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/Third Domain/Semyon Voltaire]], him being essentially unaffected to the concept's whim, which might be tied to him being born right as a change was happening, causing the bond he would have with the Concept to be strengthened - for the Concept itself paradoxically has a core identity of being the Concept - and leading to Semyon having a fixed identity.
Due to this, Semyon is the only person who is able to locate the concept consistently.
