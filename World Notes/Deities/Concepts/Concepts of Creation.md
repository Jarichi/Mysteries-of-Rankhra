# Description
The Concepts are the pieces of the body of the [[God of Creation]], which each represent a concept occurring in reality. Depending on the nature of the concept, it may take the form of a creature, an object or something else altogether.

All Concepts are represented as a pure tone, or a certain musical phrase that may be recognised by anyone who has been in direct proximity with a Concept. When observing, investigating or otherwise inspecting a Concept or anything directly influenced by it, a rhythm may be observed.

Legends speak of all rhythms to form a composition that might have, at one point, resounded all throughout the universe when the God of Creation was still alive. The body of the God (being Crafted Life and Gentle Death) would represent the composition of this magnificent piece. Crafted Life was to represent the meter, timbre and other external parts, and Gentle Death was to represent the feeling, matter of playing and other internal parts. Together, they had guided the Concepts' tones and rhythms into one cohesive masterpiece, said to have shaped the universe.
Remnants of these tones may still be found at the sites of the concepts, or in their manifestation.
