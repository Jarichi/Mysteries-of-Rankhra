# Description
The Concepts are the pieces of the body of the [[God of Creation]], which each represent a concept occurring in reality. Depending on the nature of the concept, it may take the form of a creature, an object or something else altogether.

All Concepts are represented as a pure tone, or a certain musical phrase that may be recognised by anyone who has been in direct proximity with a Concept. When observing, investigating or otherwise inspecting a Concept or anything directly influenced by it, a rhythm may be observed.

Legends speak of all rhythms to form a composition that might have, at one point, resounded all throughout the universe when the God of Creation was still alive. The body of the God (being Crafted Life and Gentle Death) would represent the composition of this magnificent piece. Crafted Life was to represent the meter, timbre and other external parts, and Gentle Death was to represent the feeling, matter of playing and other internal parts. Together, they had guided the Concepts' tones and rhythms into one cohesive masterpiece, said to have shaped the universe.
Remnants of these tones may still be found at the sites of the concepts, or in their manifestation.

Strangely, all concepts are of a paradoxical nature. The concept of flow is contained in a sphere, the concept of whimsy is a well-defined location, the concept of reflection does not truly reflect, the concept of exploration follows a certain path (cymatics), the concept of change has a defined identity, the concept of connection has not been thought out yet and the concept of growth will never grow beyond being what it is now.

## List of Concepts and their Tones
[[Concept of Flow]]
- Represented as a constant stream of notes, all flowing directly into each other, without break.
[[concept of Whimsy]]
- Represented as otherworldly chordal and melodic structures, microtonal, out of this world.
[[concept of reflection]]
- Represented as an introspective piece that mirrors its movements along both bass and treble.
[[concept of exploration]]
- Represented as an experimental jazz composition, continuously evolving and trying new sounds.
[[Concept of Change]]
- Represented as both a chaotic, unorganised flurry of sounds and shifting between several "genres".
[[Concept of connection]]
- Represented as a connected piece that joins all of the earlier Concepts together.
[[Concept of Growth]]
- Represented as a piece, seemingly building to an ever-increasing crescendo.

Note that the concepts essentially pick a group, association or other physical manifestation to execute their fundamental desire, and note that this operates outside of the standard framework of morality e.g. to manifest exploration, the concept of exploration is a mythical creature that effectively forces a group of hunters to explore the desert for eternity. They lose their memories in order to become fully devoted to their purpose.
