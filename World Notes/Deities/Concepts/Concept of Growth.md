Concept of Growth:
- this manifests itself in plant growth, and literal tall creatures
- But also self growth
- the city in which this concept resides is very spiritual an citizens might  spent most of their time meditating and connecting to other planes of existance. thie society is the Moon Circle
- the city can be situated on the highest mountain, symbolizing **growth**
	- may also jsut be a massive tree lmao (it is a massive tree)
- growing population
- but also growing expenses
- growing ideas -> city of developement -> lots of creaatively minded people who want to grow


plotpoint: needs to be kept in control since evergrowing city is obviously not good for the city -> mission for the party.


The concept is a gigantic tree and the key is a seed fractal! Twan already has this but the seed hasn't grown yet because twan hasnt grown as a person.
Everyone received some.recognising feature and twan's will turn into a fractal
