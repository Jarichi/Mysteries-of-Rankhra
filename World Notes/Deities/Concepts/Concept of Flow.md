The Concept of Flow is the true nature of the Artifact hidden away in [[Rankhra]]. It impacts the flow of water, but also the flow of time, the flow state, flow of life, people idk

- flow of time
- flow of life
- flow state (focus)
- flow of water and possibly air perventing sandstorms in the city
- flow of trade


The concept is water coming out of the temple, and the key is the water inside a magical orb which creates water.

Verdant knows about this and wants to break this orb. Everybody else believes that thsi orb IS the concepts and panics maybe fights conflict
