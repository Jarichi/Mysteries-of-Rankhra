- (stolen from honkai :3 )
- this concept is literal reflection and thus cannot be touched
- when looking at this concept it appears as a mirror
- when close to the concept you are compelled to reflect on your deeds
- it also helps you find answers you were (or didnt know you were) looking for
- this concept stores the memories of all living creatures


The concepts of reflection *is* a lake near the mountains , within Phiaro Basin with a plaque "remember your first step". To get the key (which is a memory, Rubae has this already but cannot access it) you need to think about where you started being who you are now and walk into the lake. Under the cave is a mirror of the mirror. Looming into the mirror gives you the memory.


Cynthia knows the real memory, but since she is a guardian, she shares the wrong memory with the party. She has amnesia and didn't know she was a guardian beforehand. After getting the memoty she knows she must sabotage the party to not get closer to any other concepts.
