sponsored by Shoka Engineering Collective This sponsoring also leads to a sort of debt that needs to be repaid. The Shoka ENgineering Collective has an insterest in Rankhra that they themselves don't want to be spending their own resources in, so by means of a clause in the sponsoring and threathening to withdraw, they are forcing Daan to do this for them. Not knowing where to start, Daan - joined by his assistent Aki - decide to leave the shop in order to make sure they can repay their debt.

In the introduction, this makes Daan actually have a reasonn to leave his shop behind. Perhaps I will, when I switch to their perspective, let them receive a message from the Engineering Collective by means of a COmet, informing them of this. They head out and meet Ratronus, who is desperately fleeing from *something* and decides to join them.
