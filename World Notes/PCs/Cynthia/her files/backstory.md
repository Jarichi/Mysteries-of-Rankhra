Marilyne is a warlock serving the raven queen.
==BIRTH==
Marilyne is the daughter of the Raven Queen, a child sired by the Prince of Frost. Sharaea, the fey that left him for a mortal hero (Hayne Kasar), struck a bargain with the Raven Queen to save her lover from the Prince of Frost. The terms of the bargain were as follows; She would cast their souls far ahead in time in exchange for 100 years plus the remaining years Hayne's body was supposed to live in that timeframe. Sharaea agreed and they went to her temple to offer up their material bodies and to be cast ahead in time, in different bodies with different faces, their fates intertwined so the Frost Prince could never find them.

She collected their souls and forged their bodies together, sculpting her face on the new body she created. She kept the allure Sharaea had on the Frost Prince so she could seduce him. The Raven Queen desired the Frost Prince as a consort, but needed a body to do so. She kept an opening to her realm, which she could achieve through meditation, and finished her fey body. She sought out the Prince of Frost and seduced him, feeding on his memories and keeping mementos of his pain, thriving on the pain of his loss. She made him into her courtesan and eventually he unexpectedly sired her a child. However, the time in her borrowed body was ending shortly after her child would be born. Her mortal body would not survive. She decided to bestow her gifts onto her unborn child, but it came with a cost. In order for her child to have a life, the child would have to siphon others' life essence and consume it. In other words, she would be born a vampire. An immortal needing blood to survive, a thirst that will never be fully satisfied.

The Raven Queen sacrificed her remaining time and Marilyne was born. The Raven Queen sent a raven sentinel, Marilyne's raven sentinel to bring the newborn to a Shadar-Kai woman, named Elena Lochan, who was bitten, and turned into a vampire. She became a trusted friend of the Raven Queen after they struck a bargain, where she kept her soul and became a fully risen vampire instead of being vampire spawn. In exchange, she kept a low profile, killed vampire spawn and undead throughout her lifespan, and later became an unnamed friend in her castle in the Shadowfell. 

Elena was instructed to call the child Marilyne and raise her as one of her own, giving her her last name. She was instructed to teach Marilyne the ways of a vampire and teach her the ways of magic, the ways of the blade, teach her the ways of seduction. The ways of lying and deceiving, to listen. Teach her how she could become the eyes and ears of her mother, how to be her footstep into this world and collect as much as she could for her mother.

==DRINKING BLOOD ~ story time :3

*And there i sat, my fangs buried in a fae's neck. The sweet nectar of life, coursing through my veins, the undead curse, branded on my name, defiling my mother's title. Fangs, marking fresh, unmarred skin.*

I came to this town on my mother's request. The first mission she has ever given me. After spending 20 years with Elena, i could use the peace. Elena taught me everything i know, but she was a hard woman. She told me from a very young age she was in fact, not my mother, but simply my teacher. She didn't show me much affection, but she was useful. 

About a week ago, my actual mother gave me a vision of a young maiden in a brothel. She was sold to a tall, cold, pale man. Well, not 'a man', but a vampire. He was gonna use her blood for his fill. Her body, mind and soul would be used for dark experimental rituals, summoning foul, vicious spawn. My job was to kill both the vampire and the maiden. 'maiden' was very important, my mother needed her pure soul. I didn't get names, faces or other clues, just a sense of direction and the feeling of their presence.

I started my journey, in search of this maiden and the vampire. I began to see the world. Different villages, towns and cities had stretched out before me, but the feeling kept urging me on. Even though Elena taught me everything i knew, the cultures of the humanoids suprised me. It made me question the reliability of Elena. I wondered if everything was as black and white as she had told me.

The road led me to a huge city. I admired the city from afar and met lovely creatures, handling different spices, silks, jewelery and other finaries. the gate stretched to be higher and higher when i got close, but as soon as my boot crossed the threshold, i knew. I was supposed to be here. 

after vigourously searching the whole city, i got close to nothing. i found 4 brothels, all were selling and buying and a potential vampiric meeting, heard from a whisper, who heard it from a whisper, who heard it from another whisper. So, not much really. The search had taken me well over 4 days and blood-thirst gnawed on me. I had caught myself listening to peoples quick fluttering heartbeats this afternoon. They smelled more and more delicious as i got hungrier and hungrier.

Defeated, I opted for a discreet way out, to hunt and come back in the morning, fresh-minded and full. I walked through alleyways and stumbled on some hushed, but important conversation. both heads turned my way and snarled. Vampire spawn. I dropped the glamour and snarled back. they calmed down and i interrogated them about this secretive vampire meeting. They spilled their guts immediately and i got a time, a date AND a place. I dismissed them with a sharp hiss and left the city, slightly less defeated.

I stayed in that forest. after a bloody frenzy, it was time for me to scope out this location, supposedly a hidden cave somewhere around here. After a good portion of my day searching for this cave, i stumbled upon a young woman next to a lake. i asked for her name and if she knew where this hidden cave was. Her name was Mireilah and she did in fact, know where the cave was. We started talking and i felt a familiar tug. She told me she was a young maiden, working in a brothel, training to be a courtesan. She would be sold in about a month. i could've killed her then and there, but i still needed the vampire the vision showed me. Elena taught me to know when to strike. Fate is dangerous and visions could change unexpectedly. Best way to go about this is to with the vision, instead of striking early and completely changing everything. She still had to meet the vampire.

From here, everything went so fast. The meeting was interesting, but the plan revealed there was the one i saw in my vision, so it had to be one of those vampires present. Me and Mireilah got along great and we became very close, very quick. Her auction date got closer and closer, and i seemed to care more and more. I started loving her. I told her what i was and who i was, but she didn't seem to mind. She told me her life story and that she was miserable, but had no choice to be a courtesan. She got saved by her madame and from that moment on, had a large debt in money to her. Signed away her rights.
  

7 days before her auction, she started asking an awfull lot about my feeding habits. Like if i ever considered drinking from humans, or other races. If i knew what it would be like to drink from a higher life form. I told her i never tried it, but knew it was an intimate experience. Drinking someone's blood could share memories and emotions. It could create a soul bond, if both desired by vampire and victim. If the blood was given willingly, it would be commonly paired with intimacy. She went silent after i told her that and changed the subject. 


4 days before her auction, she came to me in tears, hysterically sobbing how scared she was, how precious i was to her and how she would be shipped away and never see me again. I consoled her, but cried with her. I cried for her sorrow, but also for mine. Her life was supposed to be ending soon, before she could be mutilated. I cried for my love for her. I cried for her healing touch and her lovely eyes. Her lovely scent and beautiful soul. 

  
3 days before her auction, she was presented to suitors. In the vampiric meeting i picked up that 'the honored maiden' was to be handpicked by their leader. So i waited. Waited for my target. Once i felt who it was, i could forge a plan and kill them both.

The day of her auction, she got picked up and hush hush shipped off. I smelled her fear. I sensed her panic. Of course i followed the carriage and had to watch how they dragged her from it, kicking and screaming. My heart breaking into tiny pieces every time she fought.

Somehow i managed to sneak in and get a layout of the mansion. There were so many levels underground. Prisons and cages and screaming humanoids. Apparently this was not the first time this ritual was attempted. Mireilah was not kept in a prison, but in one of the rooms upstairs. She flung her arms around me with so much joy, happy i came to rescue her. I couldn't. I couldn't do it. I broke down and told her everything. I told her all about my history, about the vision, about the work i was sent here to do. She wept with me, 2 people finding comfort in each other. I told her about the last few months and how she made me feel.

"I want it to be you." She whispered to me. "I want you to be my beginning and my end." I looked at her, in confusion. "I want you to unravel me and drink me dry."

Another silence fell. My thought's were racing through my head and i could feel a tear form. Her tender fingers touched my face and lifted my chin. She was so close. She looked in my eyes and softly said

  *"I want to lose my virginity to the woman i love, i want to lay down my life for her and live my last night the way i want to live it. Take me Marilyne, love me like you said you do. Let me strengthen your bones and let me live on in your memory, even the short time we had together. I think i loved you from the moment you asked some stupid directions. I never saw you for the monster everyone describes vampires to be, but someone that changed my life, made me feel joy."*


Her eyes spoke deep and true. I drank her gaze in and savored her slight touch. She brought her lips to mine and kissed me. She tasted like the heavens. A kiss so tender, it would linger in my immortal memory for a long time, perhaps forever.

The kisses became more and more hungry and my blood sang to her, my senses begging for that sweet, savouring liquid. We shed our clothes and i gazed upon her magnificent form. She looked ethereal that evening. the stained glass, paired with the setting sun, painted us a dream.

She guided me towards her bed, not speaking a word and cupped my face. she guided me towards my neck, a silent plea. I bit her and heaven flushed through me. My venom did its work and soon i had her hands exploring my body and moaning my name.

We went on all night, exploring eachother, pleasuring eachother in ways, only imaginable. When sunrise rolled around, she was in my lap, leaning against me, watching the sky turn purple, then red, lovingly stroking my leg.

  

"i never thought id spend my last sunrise alive so happy." She said to me. She looked up at me and kisssed me deeply. "Im glad i ever got to fall in love" she told me. It was time. The sky was the most rich color of red i think i have ever seen in my lifetime, as if it knew the pureness of her love, the color of her blood and the day she would die. "Its time Marilyne..." She turned towards me. I kissed her for one last time and told her how much i loved her. I gently pulled her hair back, baring her neck. The soft thrumming of her blood beneath her skin struck me. Not the usual fear people displayed when they were about to die. Not the panicked heartbeats before they would stop, but a soft steady hum. Calm. Happy. 

  My fangs pierced her skin again and the taste of her blood exploded in my mouth. I grabbed her shoulder and instinct guided me. She leaned into my touch, moaning my name in pleasure. My hands instantly shot to her sex, already drunk on her blood, her body quivering in pleasure. I drank from her slowly, enjoying her taste and savouring our last moments.

  And here i sat, my fangs buried in a fae's neck. The sweet nectar of life, coursing through my veins, the undead curse, branded on my name, defiling my mother's. Fangs, marking fresh, unmarred skin. 
  

Not defiling anything, no undead curse. I had never felt so pure, so alive. Her memories, her favourites flowed through me. I felt her happiness, her love. We were intertwined, two souls together, beyond the material plane. Most of her favourite memories were with me, the berries we ate, the things we talked about. I felt her wonder, the sharp sour taste she tasted, the things we laughed about. She showed me how grateful she was, meeting me. Her healing blood strengthened me, sang to me, loved me. 

The sky was still red, turning orange when i stopped. She had molded fully into my touch and barely had her eyes open to see the sunrise. She took raspy breaths and her hearbeat was slowing. 


"I love you Marilyne... I love you so much.... Thank you..." 


I muttered it back whilst i listened to her dying body. I sank my teeth in one more time and drank the last drop of her blood, killing her and fufilling part my quest. Her body turned cold in my hands and i mourned the loss of the woman i loved.

After that everything was a haze. The plan i worked out worked flawlessly and i fufilled my quest. i couldn't be happy about it. I only felt cold. My mother wasnt pleased i took her virginity. she was furious. She cursed me out and stole my memory for decades. She put me in a frenzied haze and i dont remember a lot from that time, only that i caused a lot of harm, eventually known as 'The lady of rivers red'

When i was released from my haze, I faked my own death and started living as an elf. like before, but i took on a different idenity.

==LORE FROM INTERWEBS==
lore abt raven queen
The [Prince of Frost] hated the Raven Queen for her role in the loss of his beloved, Sharaea. The powerful fey woman had fallen in love with a mortal hero, causing him to grow jealous, and she feared for the safety of her mortal lover if she tried to deny him. She struck a bargain with the Raven Queen to cast her soul into the future, hoping that time would allow the former Sun Prince to heal, only for him to grow bitter and sorrowful, eventually turning into the Prince of Frost. The Prince delighted in usurping some of the Raven Queen's power through his association with freezing death and darkness. On her part, however, the Raven Queen desired him as an exarch or even a consort.

lore abt frost prince
The Prince of Frost was once known as the **Sun Prince**, and his realm was a place of light and summer warmth. Among the denizens of his vale were a trio of sisters called the Daughters of Delight, powerful fey from another summer realm. The most beautiful of the three was Sharaea, with whom the Sun Prince was in love, and betrothed to; Sharaea loved him in return.

Eventually, however, Sharaea grew bored with the endless revelry of the fey and left it for the Material Plane, where she fell in love with a mortal hero named Hayne Kasar, and fought against the forces of darkness at his side. The Sun Prince soon grew jealous and demanded that she honor her promise and marry him. When she refused, the Prince swore that he would not let her go, even if he had to hold her prisoner. Sharaea, not strong enough to face him and fearing for the safety of her mortal lover, instead made a bargain with the [Raven Queen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Raven_Queen "Raven Queen") that cast her soul and her lover's soul far ahead in time. She intended that the time would allow the Sun Prince to calm and heal.

Instead, the Sun Prince grew bitter with sorrow and his sunny realm turned into one of winter night. His heart turned to ice and he left his name behind when he left the Summer Court.
