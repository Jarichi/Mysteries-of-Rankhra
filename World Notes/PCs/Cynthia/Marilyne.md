## Summary of cynthia's backstory
Helena taught her everything she knows
has kept herself hidden from society and as such has experience with 

she went to a city and learnt about a vampire meeting, and needs to kill a girl (miraeilah) who is going to be used in a ritual (love interest)

Elena (mother) instructed her as a vampre to kill the vampre lord and the maiden

the girl is an elf and love each other, but she needed ot be killed by Marilyne.

party will get a quest to go to the reflection pond and such, and 



statblock for marilyn herself as vampire 

3 sheets, one with actual power, one with the fake persona and cynthia has one with her scaled down power level, even tho 


## Stats
considering her health pool is extremely high comparred to the rest, we can say that when she reaches the average party hp, she pretends to be dead.
	some sort of bs story that tells that she gets revived by her patron as a punishment for her deeds, eternal suffering idk
		we need to come up with a better idea eventually...

we will rule that the stats and abilities and such are the base level 3 stats that scale with the party, and only when cynthia activates her max level for some reason, the stats
