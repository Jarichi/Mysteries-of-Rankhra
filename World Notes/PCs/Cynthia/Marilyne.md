BBEG for the first arc. (maybe)

This character is most likely connected to Cynthia's character lore. She might join a bit later in the campaign due to personal issues

warlock vampire sorta a daywalker, maybe getting the artifact is a way to overcome the weakening effect of the sun on her appearance, Rubae is completely unrecognisable and will be represented as a "strong magical force" or something. She blows up Frederic and attempts to leave, yadda yadda the rest of the session planning. 
She tortured Frederic to get the information out of him, before killing him, and the party intercepted this

vampires have a bad rep maybe on low health, she turns into a vampire-like creature again and needs to find blood or something to return to "normal"
throne of Glass, iron witch

(backstory idea)
Rubae is the daughter of the Raven Queen, a child sired by the Prince of Frost. Sharaea, the fey that left him for a mortal hero (Hayne Kasar), struck a bargain with the Raven Queen to save her lover from the Prince of Frost. The terms of the bargain were as follows; She would cast their souls far ahead in time in exchange for 100 years plus the remaining years Hayne's body was supposed to live in that timeframe. Sharaea agreed and they went to her temple to offer up their material bodies and to be cast ahead in time, in different bodies with different faces, their fates intertwined so the Frost Prince could never find them.

She collected their souls and forged their bodies together, sculpting her face on the new body she created. She kept the allure Sharaea had on the Frost Prince so she could seduce him. The Raven Queen desired the Frost Prince as a consort, but needed a body to do so. She kept an opening to her realm, which she could achieve through meditation, and finished her fey body. She sought out the Prince of Frost and seduced him, feeding on his memories and keeping mementos of his pain, thriving on the pain of his loss. She made him into her courtesan and eventually he unexpectedly sired her a child. However, the time in her borrowed body was ending shortly after her child would be born. Her mortal body would not survive. She decided to bestow her gifts onto her unborn child, but it came with a cost. In order for her child to have a life, the child would have to siphon others' life essence and consume it. In other words, she would be born a vampire. An immortal needing blood to survive, a thirst that will never be fully satisfied.

The Raven Queen sacrificed her remaining time and Rubae was born. The Raven Queen sent a raven sentinel, Rubae's raven sentinel to bring the newborn to a Shadar-Kai woman, named Elena Lochan, who was bitten, and turned into a vampire. She became a trusted friend of the Raven Queen after they struck a bargain, where she kept her soul and became a fully risen vampire instead of being vampire spawn. In exchange, she kept a low profile, killed vampire spawn and undead throughout her lifespan, and later became an unnamed friend in her castle in the Shadowfell. 

Elena was instructed to call the child Rubae and raise her as one of her own, giving her her last name. She was instructed to teach Rubae the ways of a vampire and teach her the ways of magic, the ways of the blade, teach her the ways of seduction. The ways of lying and deceiving, to listen. Teach her how she could become the eyes and ears of her mother, how to be her footstep into this world and collect as much as she could for her mother.

lore abt raven queen
The [Prince of Frost](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Prince_of_Frost "Prince of Frost") hated the Raven Queen for her role in the loss of his beloved, Sharaea. The powerful fey woman had fallen in love with a mortal hero, causing him to grow jealous, and she feared for the safety of her mortal lover if she tried to deny him. She struck a bargain with the Raven Queen to cast her soul into the future, hoping that time would allow the former Sun Prince to heal, only for him to grow bitter and sorrowful, eventually turning into the Prince of Frost. The Prince delighted in usurping some of the Raven Queen's power through his association with freezing death and darkness. On her part, however, the Raven Queen desired him as an exarch or even a consort.

lore abt frost prince
The Prince of Frost was once known as the **Sun Prince**, and his realm was a place of light and summer warmth. Among the denizens of his vale were a trio of sisters called the Daughters of Delight, powerful fey from another summer realm. The most beautiful of the three was Sharaea, with whom the Sun Prince was in love, and betrothed to; Sharaea loved him in return.

Eventually, however, Sharaea grew bored with the endless revelry of the fey and left it for the Material Plane, where she fell in love with a mortal hero named Hayne Kasar, and fought against the forces of darkness at his side. The Sun Prince soon grew jealous and demanded that she honor her promise and marry him. When she refused, the Prince swore that he would not let her go, even if he had to hold her prisoner. Sharaea, not strong enough to face him and fearing for the safety of her mortal lover, instead made a bargain with the [Raven Queen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Raven_Queen "Raven Queen") that cast her soul and her lover's soul far ahead in time. She intended that the time would allow the Sun Prince to calm and heal.

Instead, the Sun Prince grew bitter with sorrow and his sunny realm turned into one of winter night. His heart turned to ice and he left his name behind when he left the Summer Court.
