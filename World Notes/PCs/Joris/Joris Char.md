Deep within the confines of the outer city, next to all the garbage, thievery and extortion one can imagine. There existed a couple of small rat-like humanoid families with threads moving deep into the underworld. These figures were selected for their inconspicuous appearance and their very agile physical traits. These families' were able to go underwater, climb steep walls and much more, depending on what they were trained to do. This went on for a significant amount of time, generations long, generations of pure torture, extortion and greed. If the family did not offer up their children for these 'trainings' they were given 'privileges', these included things such as daily whippings, food stores being destroyed and at times, could mean death.

The people who extorted and abused these families were refered to as overlords, they deemed themselves above the law, above nature and they saw themselves as holy, as close to god as one could come. They did not need their 'entity' names nor had any appeal for the comfort of others. They simply went by whatever god fit them best. Their victims were marked with a very distinct maroon-coloured eye just under the right-side shoulder. A marking of their 'god', each person was assigned one overlord at a time, that is up until a certain individual raised to the occasion. His parents offered him up and he underwent the training as they all do, yet this individual managed to gain the courage to fight his opressors. He rejected his overlord and managed to rob one of them of their lives, after narrowly escaping his overlords he dumped everything. His name, his family and whatever was left of him, then he simply moved forward as he had to. His took upon himself the name Ratronus.

Currently thinking about how to integrate this with the lore I currently have. Below are some notes 
### What I like
- Small families of Simics that have been specially trained by a power, to fulfill certain tasks
- Familiy Drama and traumatic backstory
- Reason for leaving this world and setting out upon the world.
- Interesting premise
#### Expansions
- Expand on WHY these families are being suppressed specifically
- Expand on how these overlords came to be
- Expand on what Ratronus left behind
### What can be changed
- Overlords see themselves as holy. DOes this mean that they operate singularily, or are still being controlled or influenced by the other crime groups in the campaign?
	- By extension, why are they not really being handled and are allowed to run rampant like this?
- Character doesn't currently have a certain specific goal
- Timebase for how long specifically this has been going on
