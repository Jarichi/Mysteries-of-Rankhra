[[The Hyphaedo]], [[Overlord]], 
## Rulings
Mage Hand ruling:

Starting at 3rd level, when you cast [Mage Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand), you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:

- You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.

- You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.

- You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.

You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check.

In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.









Abused in his younger years
Might not be as mean as he appears, but he was raised that way.
If anyone that even resembles an overlord appears, he willl immediately kill them
If he sees eliazabeth hell break the fuck down yo

He's a reasonable person (he do be a businessman)
Fear of attachement.
