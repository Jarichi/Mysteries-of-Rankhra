Deep within the confines of the outer city, next to all the garbage, thievery and extortion one can imagine. There existed a couple of small rat-like humanoid families with threads moving deep into the underworld. These figures were selected for their inconspicuous appearance and their very agile physical traits. These families' were able to go underwater, climb steep walls and much more, depending on what they were trained to do. This went on for a significant amount of time, generations long, generations of pure torture, extortion and greed. If the family did not offer up their children for these 'trainings' they were given 'privileges', these included things such as daily whippings, food stores being destroyed and at times, could mean death.

The people who extorted and abused these families were refered to as overlords, they deemed themselves above the law, above nature and they saw themselves as holy, as close to god as one could come. They did not need their 'entity' names nor had any appeal for the comfort of others. They simply went by whatever god fit them best. Their victims were marked with a very distinct maroon-coloured eye just under the right-side shoulder. A marking of their 'god', each person was assigned one overlord at a time, that is up until a certain individual raised to the occasion. His parents offered him up and he underwent the training as they all do, yet this individual managed to gain the courage to fight his opressors. He rejected his overlord and managed to rob one of them of their lives, after narrowly escaping his overlords he dumped everything. His name, his family and whatever was left of him, then he simply moved forward as he had to. His took upon himself the name Ratronus.

Mage Hand ruling:

Starting at 3rd level, when you cast [Mage Hand](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand), you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:

- You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.

- You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.

- You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.

You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check.

In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.









Abused in his younger years
Might not be as mean as he appears, but he was raised that way.
If anyone that even resembles an overlord appears, he willl immediately kill them
If he sees eliazabeth hell break the fuck down yo

He's a reasonable person (he do be a businessman)
Fear of attachement.
