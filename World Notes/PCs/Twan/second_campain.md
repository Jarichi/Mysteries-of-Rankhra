# The backstory of Chrone of the Woods
## The beginning
The story of Chrone begins at the foot of a massive mountain located in the
south-west of the Makshar desert. Here he just lay in the snowy terrain, waiting
for someone to find him. The problem with finding him however is that he is as
white as the snow. The thing however that sticks out, is his beginning
copperish hair. 

Eventually, Chrone was found by someone simply tripping over him while gathering
berries. The person that tripped over him was at first confused as to why he
tripped. So, he backtracked his steps in the snow but couldn't find anything
odd. But when he looked a second time, he saw something green hiding inside the
snow. When he went closer, it even made a sound. He picked Chrone up and was so
surprised to find him that he almost fell over again. He started to immediately 
walk back to the top of the mountain. He knew who he found, and the circle should 
know this too. 

After walking up back to the top, he gathered the members of the circle
together to announce who he found. The members gathered quickly, since it
seemed urgent. He announced that he had found THE birch elf. The leader of the
circle walked up to him as a wolf, to see if what he spoke was the truth. 
He transformed back to his more human form and took a look at Chrone. 
He announced that THE birch elf was indeed found and that the preparations
should be started.

## Fast forward to adulthood
When a member in the circle of the moon reaches adulthood, the member will take
part in The Trials. The Trails are meant for members to get acquainted with the
concept of wild form. But the most important part of The Trials is to be
officially accepted as a circle of the moon druid. 

### The Trials
The Trials consist of the following stages:  
1. The first stage is to befriend an animal, this is to show the faith the
   member has in nature and to trust it.
2. The second stage of the trial is to pacify an otherwise hostile creature. The
   goal is to show that even a hostile create can be a friend to a druid.
3. If the first two stages are completed successfully, the member is allowed to
   have a first conversation with the Great Tree. This is only possible through
   the new befriended creatures the druid has made. The Great Tree can communicate
   through these creatures. During this conversation the Great Tree then decides
   if you are worthy enough to be a circle of the moon druid. If the tree
   decides that you are worthy, you are allowed into the circle. However, if
   the tree declines you, your memory of the circle will be wiped.

When Chrone reached the age of 45, he was considered an adult by the circle. On
his birthday, the leader called [[Wolf]] (called after his wild shape) told him about 
The Trials. Once Chrone heard about this, he immediately wanted to begin. Wolf
was happy to hear this and guided him outside of the village. Once outside, Wolf
left Chrone to his search and went back inside.

### The friendly animal
Chrone stumbled down the mountain side in search of an animal. After searching for
what felt like hours, he saw something in the corner of his eyes. It was just
sitting there, staring at him. Chrone turned to the creature to stare it back into
it's eyes. The create seemed to be a giant eagle, but friendly. Chrone started
to slowly walk towards it, the eagle just stared at him. When he was almost
standing next to the eagle, it hopped down from its rock towards him. At this
moment Chrone knew, that he had found his first friendly creature. He held out his 
arm, and the eagle flew onto his arm.

### The not so friendly animal
With his newfound companion, Chrone stumbled even further down the mountain. He
even started to see some grass through the snow. He started to enter a forest,
but at this point he was too tired to continue. So, he and his companion settled 
down besides a tree to rest for a few minutes. But the rest did not take long, 
because he was greeted with the roar that he could not recognize. Chrone stood 
up and started to look for the source of the noise. When he looked, he couldn't 
see anything that could have made that noise. He started to relax for a bit, but
was then greeted with the same sound, only this time it was coming from behind
him. And it sounded close. He turned around and was standing face to face with a
great brown bear. Chrone knew what the circle had thought him, stand your
ground. But most importantly, act friendly. 

The first thing Chrone did, was to simply wave at the bear. The bear looked back 
at him confused, but seemed to understand the signal. The bear walked towards Chrone 
slowly. So, Chrone did the same, but even slower. Once standing close enough to 
each other, they both stopped. Chrone held out his hand to sort of shake the paw 
of the bear. So, the bear put his nose in his hand. This was the sign for Chrone 
that he had completed his second stage of The Trials. 

### The talk to the Great Tree
Chrone walked back up the mountain, back to the village. But not alone, for he
now had two new friends to accompany him. The great brown bear, which he named
Barry. And the giant eagle, who he named Clyde. He didn't even have to walk,
Barry allowed him to ride on his back. Back at the gates of the village, he was
again greeted by Wolf, who was surprised to see a brown bear so high up in the
mountain area. He guided the newly formed trio to the cave where the Great Tree
lives. At the entrance of the cave, Wolf stopped and told them that this journey
is not meant for him. 

The trio walked through a quite dark tunnel to be greeted by a ray of sunlight 
that shines through a hole in the mountain. Chrone, who got blinded by the ray of 
sunlight stopped, while Barry and Clyde kept on walking. When Chrone recovered, 
he heard an unknown voice. At first he couldn't recognize it, but then 
realized it was the tree talking through Barry and Clyde. It seemed to be talking 
about some sort of birch elf. It took a moment for Chrone to realize that the Great 
Tree was talking about him. 

The Great Tree told him about the prophecy about a birch elf being found and 
the rise of a city in the northern parts of the Makshar desert. He started to 
explain the concept of growth and that there are more of these divine artifacts
around the world. *It is foretold that... [insert prophecy]* The Great Tree however, 
is worried that something is happening to the artifact of flow. He told Chrone
that he should go and investigate the artifact. But the only clue that the Great 
Tree gave as of the whereabouts of the artifacts is that it should be in an urban 
area.

Chrone, who is at this point overwhelmed with information, just asks one
question in return. "So ... I can stay in the circle?". To which the Great Tree
just replies with a laugh and says "Of course, why do you think I otherwise say
these things to you?". At this point the light started to get dimmer, and
Barry and Clyde went back to normal.

## His goal 
At this point, Chrone knew what his goal was. He would travel north with Barry
and Clyde and investigate the area of interest. He told Wolf about what the
Great Tree told him, he understood it immediately and waved them goodbye.
He started to travel the same night to the north. After a few months of traveling
Chrone arrived at the other end of the desert. Confused as to why he had missed
the city, he just started to wait and see if and where the foretold city would
be build.

After waiting and traveling for many years, Chrone saw the start of a small
city. He immediately knew that this was the city that the Great Tree foretold 
and stayed close to the city over the many hundreds of years over which is was
build.
