When the threads of magic grow thin,  
And whispers rise on winds of change,  
An unknown hand, with shadowed grin, 
Seeks to bind the Flow and rearrange.

In the midst of brass and steam,  
Where iron wheels turn by the stream,  
The **Flow**, untouched, yet not alone,  
Now waits as unseen forces scheme.

Five paths shall converge as one,  
Birch Elf of leaves and ancient bark, 
Must venture forth and start the run,
A guardian who’s lost their way,  
From lands afar, in lightless sway,  
A creature small, both keen and stark,  
An everyman of mortal birth,  
And fey who laughs amidst the mirth.

Together, they must seek the door,  
Through temple halls where **Flow** is caught,  
But greater still lies something more—  
A puzzle waits, with fate to thwart.

For the **Concepts Seven** must unite,  
To forge Creation’s primal heart,  
Through **blessings**, earned by trial’s might,  
And in their merging, play their part.

Each Concept holds a vital key,  
To weave the broken threads anew,  
And only when all powers agree,  
Shall the mural’s light come into view.

So gather the **blessings**, one by one,  
For without them, this plane shall fall,  
The fate of all beneath the sun  
Depends on merging one and all.
