### Etymology and General Info
Sheikah :3

Alignment: probably some shade of neutral evil, since they are willing to bend laws to fulfill their own needs - being at the top of developement.
# Description
Located within the center of Zal'Aata and lead by [[../First Domain/Everon Lunares]], they guide the city to the forefront of technological advancement. Within its legions dwell the region's most prominent scientists, artificers, wizards and artisans, willing to push the boundaries of what may be possible when uniting arcane magic with Steampunk technology. They also sponsor the [[../Second Domain/Lettered Lamenting/ResearchGroup]]
# Goals
The Shoka Engineering Collective stands as a beacon of innovation and a breeding ground for advanced technologies. Its primary goal is to propel Zal'Aata to the top of technological discoveries, ensuring that the city remains a beacon of progress and prosperity. Through exhaustive research and experimentation, the organisation continuously develops new technologies.

They are currently in possession of the [[../../The Book of Life (magic item|Book of Life]].md), and are actively sacrificing people to it in order to read about events in the future. They are also looking for a way to channel one's life energy to a different person, so a more "important" person may read their future at the cost of a different human life. These inventions are punblished in a separate journal.
# Notable contributions
## Transportation
They are responsible for allowing the Phiaro Channel to form by cleverly routing the limitless supply of water coming from Rankhra to pre-made channels and passageways, allowing for the water to carve the channel, allowing for a shorter route through the desert and in turn enabling exhaustive trading to occur.
They have also designed machinery that makes it easier for citizens to travel within the city and the desert by crafting automatic cars, public transport and a sort of desert gliding boat, powered by magical energy or regular energy, depending on the needs of the users.
## Infrastructure
The organisation has crafted simple things like streetlights and neon signage, to complex structures like the [[../Aether Firmament]], made possible by a combination of artificers and wizards, constructing what might be the largest magical artifact in the direct area.
They also are the main distributors of the Scientific Journal and determine what information gets spread, educating the public and ensuring plenty of sponsorship to keep the organisation afloat. They also have ties with the government that is also using them as a sort of propaganda machine, controlling what inventions get spread to the public. The government has access to a more freely approved journal edition that contains meaningful discoveries that the public doesn't have to know about. The center is called the [[../First Domain/Distribution Center]].

# Membership
Members are obliged to have a high-level scholarship and must have written a paper beforehand. As a result, only prominent artificers, wizards, scientists etc are part of this exclusive group. Generally speaking, all races are welcome, but due to systematic classicism, certain races are viewed as less intelligent or worthy and their papers are more swiftly rejected.
# Locations

Their main quarters are in the [[../First Domain]], the distribution center is in the [[../Second Domain]].
