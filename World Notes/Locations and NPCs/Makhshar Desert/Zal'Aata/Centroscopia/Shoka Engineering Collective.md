# Description
Located within the center of Zal'Aata, they guide the city to the forefront of technological advancement. Within its legions dwell the region's most prominent scientists, artificers, wizards and artisans, willing to push the boundaries of what may be possible when uniting arcane magic with Steampunk technology. 
# Goals
The Shoka Engineering Collective stands as a beacon of innovation and a breeding ground for advanced technologies. Its primary goal is to propel Zal'Aata to the top of technological discoveries, ensuring that the city remains a beacon of progress and prosperity. Through exhaustive research and experimentation, the organisation continuously develops new technologies.

# Notable contributions
## Transportation
They are responsible for allowing the Phiaro Channel to form by cleverly routing the limitless supply of water coming from Rankhra to pre-made channels and passageways, allowing for the water to carve the channel, allowing for a shorter route through the desert and in turn enabling exhaustive trading to occur.
They have also designed machinery that makes it easier for citizens to travel within the city and the desert by crafting automatic cars, public transport and a sort of desert gliding boat, powered by magical energy or regular energy, depending on the needs of the users.
## Infrastructure
The organisation has crafted simple things like streetlights and neon signage, to complex structures like the [[World Notes/Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/Aether Firmament]], made possible by a combination of artificers and wizards, constructing what might be the largest magical artifact in the direct area.
They also are the main contributors of the Scientific Journal, educating the public and ensuring plenty of sponsorship to keep the organisation afloat.
