Cedar Zendikar (they/them, this time for real) is a famous biologist who specialises in the native fauna of Cornucopia Streak. They are known for their work on mapping and tracking the population totals of most creatures and hold a bi-weekly conference.

While their name has been dropped in arc 1, they have not had an appearance yet, however they might become significant for the Concept of Growth later on. I might just write a singular character (or character duo) that will be relevant for every concept.
