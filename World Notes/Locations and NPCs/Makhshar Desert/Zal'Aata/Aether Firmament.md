# Description
Conceived by the [[World Notes/Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/Centroscopia/Shoka Engineering Collective]], this dome was created as a means to limit the effects of light pollution due to the nocturnal lifestyle of Zal'Aata's denizens. It emulates the current position of the stars - with a few additions - and provides a serene and creative way of viewing the stards amidst the city's nocturnal glow.

### Functionality
The Aether Firmament is not only used as an observatory, but also provides a way for communication across the city. After using a special arcane device known as a [[World Notes/Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/Comet]], users can transmit any message through the heavens. This message manifests as a shining star travelling through the heavens towards its destination, after which the recipient receives the message as either a telepathic transmission, or as a physical letter.
