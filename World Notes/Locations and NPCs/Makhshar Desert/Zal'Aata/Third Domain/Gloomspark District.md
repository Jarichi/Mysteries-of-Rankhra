#location 

The gloomspark district is a section of the Third Domain which is effectively a maze like network of tunnels, of which there are no known maps and which appear to flow around one another.
This district contains a collection of small towns in which people live, entryways which all enter the maze at different points, and a collection of many tunnels which all lead into one another.



# Known Entrypoints
- Right next to Lettered Lamenting, one may observe a large sewer entryway. This is the most widely used entrypoint which leads to Gloomspark Mantle.
- One manhole cover near the University of Arcane Arts directly leads into one of the paths. This is generally where Rateonus' informants provide information
- near the edge of the city, there is a breakable wall which leads to an exit

# Known Villages
- Gloomspark Mantle -  A Small collection of houses which have been abandoned as per the occurences of the first session. This location serves as the main entry point into the network of tunnels and as an intel transition location for informants.
