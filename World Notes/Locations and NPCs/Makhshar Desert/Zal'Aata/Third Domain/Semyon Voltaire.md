#npc 
Semyon Voltaire is a human (?) wizard who specialises in the school of divination. He is the current leader of [[F.I.Z.]] and mostly operates outside of the public view. Despite not orignially being from the city, he possesses a large amount of knowledge on everything going on within the city, going as far back as its beginnings. He is [[Verdant Selemno]] partner in both senses of the word, and currently lives within the [[Third Domain]].
## History
### Birth and Childhood
Growing up in [[Yataghatay]], it was not to be expected to have any form of constant identity. The ever-changing inhabitants and the ever-shifting city encouraged change, but Semyon never felt fully at ease amidst the chaos. He yearned for a more constant self-image, a more constant identity. This was not helped due to his father leaving the city shortly after his birth, and his mother - in true changeling spirit - also constantly changed her partner. These factors ultimately lead Semyon to leave the city in search of a better place, on a journey of self-discovery.
Wandering the desert eventually brought him to Zal'Aata. Hoping that this city would give him a chance to become his own person, he attempted to enter the city, but was rejected at the gate due to his appearance as a changeling. Semyon was perplexed but saw this as an opportunity to finally assume a more definite form, and decided to assume the form of an ordinary human, and as such made his way into the city.
### Arrival in the City
Semyon, however, hadn't planned for the fact that you needed to have credentials and despite his intrinsic ability for magic was not allowed to work any entry-level jobs that would allow him to make a living. This forced him into poverty and made him look for a better way of living.
This lead him to the city's Third Domain, where (as far as he knew) the poor and homeless reside. Luckily, money was of no use here and since he was from the City of Change, this information allowed him to get a simple home.

He realised that while the information he has was fresh and valuable for now, this would surely not remain forever. Thus, he decided to look for ways to use his history as a means to perhaps gather more intelligence and lead himself to the [[F.I.Z.]], which he infiltrated to get the attention of the higher-ups. This lead them to offer Semyon a starter job as a spy which allowed him to use his changeling features and arcane potential, mainly divination.

Semyon amassed reputation and statue, and climbed through the ranks. However, due to his rapidly rising status he became a threat to the mysterious leader of the agency, who resentfully ordered a hit on Semyon. However, working among the highest ranking officers, he was able to discover this in advance, prevented this hit and found out who ordered this; [[Rithic Voltaire]]. Semyon decided to go after him and killed him to usurp power. However, to his shock, Rithic ended up being a changeling, and his father. 

This is when he became aware of a curious Eladrin, who seemed to amass their own network. Intrigued by the parallel between them, Semyon decided to open up a means of communication and invite this Eladrin to his favourite cafe where he routinely started his day drinking a singular cappuccino. The rest is history.

### Drafting
Realising that this information was only worth so much, he made the beginnings of his own personal growth plan and attempted to land a job at the [[F.I.Z.]]. (lack of inspiration so drafting stuff atm). He used his skills as a changeling (masters of disguise) and divinity magic to gather information and work his way up in the ranks of the agency. Eventually, his employer died under suspicious circumstances and he assumed this role, making him the leader of the agency.

This is when he found out about Verdant and observed them, and interlinks with their backstory. Kinda want him to be in love with Verdant as well, and might let the party decide if they wanna romance them hmm

I dont want him to be of high descent, so He did not enter the first or second domain, and I think I want him to kind of enter the third domain where he learned what he knows now. I don't really know how I want to write him further tho. Might need to look into this later... He is a changeling tho, who took on the form of a human and ascended to leader of the agency. He obv came from the ciry of change which he fled for reasons, and ended up in zal aata. He probably wasnt as successful in his career which caused him to go to the 3rd domain. here, he was more successful due to what the 3rd means. (in the sense that information has avlue and money doesnt exist). He mightve been an elusive criminal once, who eventually got caught by the former leader of the agency and got enlisted.

I kind of wanna make him a mysterious character, both morally and appearance-wise. I also haven't written a single tragic backstory yet so it's about time.
