## Quest
In order to find her, the part must follow a series of clues. The first clue was in the form of an anonymous letter to the research group and its contents are summarised in the letter Verdant gave the party. Upon solving this clue, the party is lead to a separate area that contains trails of some sort of fight and a trail of where she ran to. When the party follows the trails, they will find Salina hidden away, who will recognise the party belongs to Verdant.
