This title is assigned to those who have essentially been chosen by the [[../../../../Deities/Concepts/Concept of Flow]] to control and manage the flow of information, by any means possible. They are willing to make their own people suffer and marginalised to fulfill their duty
Becoming an overlord subjects the participant to memory loss, that removes their goals and replaces it with the Concept's sacred direction, namely controlling the flow of information.

While devoid of their own memories, they are not devoid of their original personality, unfortunately, most subjects have megalomanica tendencies and misuse their power to control a group of people - still within the confines of the Concept's meaning.

If an Overlord goes outside their restraints, they are stripped of their power and memories and left as an empty shell.

Overlords are monitored by the F.I.Z. and their movements are tracked accordingly.

## Becoming an overlord
[descibe process]

## Location and Groups
Overlords are a noteable feature of the [[../Third Domain]], essentially acting as a mafia that offers protection and relative stability at the cost of receiving information.

## Noteable overlords
- [[Azoren]] - The original overlord that controlled Ratronus' family and one of the oldest overlordsm thereby innately familiar with the Concept's bounds. They live in close proximity to the concept of flow;
- [[Elizabeth]] - Ratronus' former lover, who betrayed him and sacrificed their relationship, because she was chosen by the concept of flow to become an overlord - something that is not done lightly - But who has vowed to remain true to herself, to protect the concept of flow. She saw visions, essentially she was a seer;
- [[Dako]] - Currently in the process of ascending to overlord. She is responsible for the original newspaper article.

## DM notes
