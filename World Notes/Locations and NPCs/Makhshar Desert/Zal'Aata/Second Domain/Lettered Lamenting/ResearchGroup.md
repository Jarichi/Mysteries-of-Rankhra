starts out good but as more lore is discovered they slowly turn BBEG and will do something that causes the collapse of society or smthn

Founded not long ago, [[ResearchGroup]] was created by [[Verdant Selemno]], in the hops of going beyond what other groups have achieved. They are localised in the cafe [[Lettered Lamenting|"Lettered Lamenting]]".

# Description
ResearchGRoup was founded by [[Verdant Selemno]] to attemtp to uncover the mysteries of the mysterious temple at the centre of Zal'Aata, and to honour their ancestors. Using the recent developements in technology and the large information network of [[Semyon Voltaire]], the research group is well-equipped for this task.






Not long ago, Rankhradventurers was founded by [[Verdant Selemno]], in the hopes of continuing on the foundational work of older research groups by using the recent developments in technology and utilising the diverse skillset of its leader. Members are assigned missions to either retrieve more information on business related to Rankhra, or control information on Rankhra.

# Organisation and Management
## Management
The group is lead by a single leader and their partner, who each manage different parts of the organisation. This partner mainly deals with resource management and mainly acts as the frontman of the group, while the leader deals with more subtle and background matters. For example, the partner introduces the missions and does the research, while the leader mainly focuses on ensuring that the mission results are correctly handled, not shying away from more... clandestine matters.

## Membership
Members of the group are entitled to a variable pay based on mission difficulty, with a minimum of 50 gold per person. Members also have access to the [[Hotel]], where they are provided with free housing and breakfast.

# Political landscape
Since Rankhradventurers is a relatively new group, but with a relatively influential leader, they have a solid footing with regards to the rest of Zal'Aata. However, due to their leader, they are also discreetly being investigated by the [[F.I.Z.]].
