	- Always in the café with a glas of water/other light beverage
	- when talked to he speaks of his adventures at the great sea but he exxagerates these stories
		- i once defeated a kraken (it was a small squid).
			- 
		- A storm killed half my men (it didn't, they just left his ship because the paladin is a bad captain)
		- My trading routes are famous because i'm the best (he isn't, and he doesn't have a trading route. He just smuggled a crate with fish over the border.)
