# Centroscopia
- [[World Notes/Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/Centroscopia/Great Acadamy of Arcane Arts]] - Reasonably highly esteemed magic school, currently in the midst of the teaching season.
- [[World Notes/Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/Centroscopia/Rankhra]] - Obviously
- [[World Notes/Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/Centroscopia/Shoka Engineering Collective]] - As of arc 2, completely inaccessible. Entry is technically allowed however anti-magical artificer tools are installed to suppress magical tomfoolery and possibly also alert people of magic users.
# First Domain
- [[World Notes/Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/First Domain/Bazaar]] - Market district. Most likely need to divide this in subcategories since this is honestly a large part of the First domain.
