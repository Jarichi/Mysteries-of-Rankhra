# Centroscopia
- [[Great Acadamy of Arcane Arts]] - Reasonably highly esteemed magic school, currently in the midst of the teaching season.
- [[Rankhra]] - Obviously
- [[Shoka Engineering Collective]] - As of arc 2, completely inaccessible. Entry is technically allowed however anti-magical artificer tools are installed to suppress magical tomfoolery and possibly also alert people of magic users.

# First Domain
- [[Bazaar]] - Market district. Most likely need to divide this in subcategories since this is honestly a large part of the First domain.
## [[Bazaar]]
- some
- interesting
- markets
- and
- shops
- as well as misc stuff

- [[Distribution Center]] - Newspaper agency. Might be affiliated to [[Shoka Engineering Collective]] to spread the scientific journal, serves as a central point where all messaging from Comets is originated and handled from. 
	- Reasons for visiting might include simply getting more knowledge about howw to use the Comets they've been handed - maybe "jailbreaking" a comet to do interesting stuff assuming I still let Semyon spy.

- definitely want to add more instrere


# Second Domain
