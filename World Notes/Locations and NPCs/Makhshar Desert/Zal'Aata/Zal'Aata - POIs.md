[link to all places in zal'aata as well as a semi-detailed map and a brief summary]

# Centroscopia
- [[Great Acadamy of Arcane Arts]] - Reasonably highly esteemed magic school, currently in the midst of the teaching season.
- [[Rankhra]] - Obviously
- [[Shoka Engineering Collective]] - As of arc 2, completely inaccessible. Entry is technically allowed however anti-magical artificer tools are installed to suppress magical tomfoolery and possibly also alert people of magic users.
- 

# First Domain
- [[Bazaar]] - Market district. Most likely need to divide this in subcategories since this is honestly a large part of the First domain.
## [[Bazaar]]
- Feywild trader delegation
	- Sells feywild wares but their stock is dwindling
	- They have a large backlog and are aware of the feywild plants that are growing within Rankhra however they do not know how to get inside
	- they know who Aki is and also know that they don't intend to betray her
	- Looking for a way back into the feywild, with suspiucinos that the concept of flow is influencing the feywild.
- Badawi Hunter tribe delegation 
	- Sells Aurich hunting tools
		- Guns
		- Armor
		- Potions of Sneak (porobabl)
	- This delegation is manned by Bleeder and is manned by [[Charlie Abbott|Bleeder]] and [[Shivank Aaraka]]
	- Shiv does not know that bleeder is part of the hunter group and even though bleeder does know abouyt this, he forget swhen he leaves the camp
- markets
- and
- shops
- as well as misc stuff

- [[Distribution Center]] - Newspaper agency. Might be affiliated to [[Shoka Engineering Collective]] to spread the scientific journal, serves as a central point where all messaging from Comets is originated and handled from. 
	- Reasons for visiting might include simply getting more knowledge about howw to use the Comets they've been handed - maybe "jailbreaking" a comet to do interesting stuff assuming I still let Semyon spy.

- definitely want to add more interesting stuff to here


# Second Domain
- [[Lettered Lamenting]] - Main missiongiver hub area
- [[Artifact store]] - Run by Shiv, he sells cool shit for high prices, provides the occasional tidbit of info. Is a cool dude who may play a larger role in the story.
- [[Great Library]] - Main library of the city. Contains knowledge about a lot of things if course, but also has a direct connection to the Third Domain, serving as an information vault, where all gathered information can be stored and saved under the name of some individual wanting to keep their info safe. Party might discover some interesting tidbids of information here.

# Third Domain
- [[That one village I created on a whim]]
- [[Mycelio]] - HEadquarters of main criminal group, will definitely have story significance for the COncept of Flow.
