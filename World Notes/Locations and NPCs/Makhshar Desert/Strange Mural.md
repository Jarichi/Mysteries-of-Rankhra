Located within [[Janib'Rankhra]], this strange mural seems to depict an intricate pattern and circular structure, represented with seven small gemstones paired with seven large gems embedded into the mural.

The smaller gemstones appear to respond to the party members, each member linked to a particular gemstone, though the reasons for this are not known.
