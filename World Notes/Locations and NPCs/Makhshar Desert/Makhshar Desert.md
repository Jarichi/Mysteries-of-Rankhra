# Description
The Makhshar Desert is a gigantic, seemingly infinitely stretching plain of sand and dunes, but can be separated into several specific landmarks. It is quite cold at night but reasonably hot during the day. As such, most travel occurs at dawn and dusk. 
## Landmark 1 - Grand Desert Plains
The largest portion of the desert is divided into the Grand Desert Plains, consisting mostly of sandy dunes and large swats of sand. The plains also serve as the space between the more diverse landmarks and act as a canvas on which the desert painted its features. The harsh conditions forced creatures and flora to adapt to a more subsurface level and cactus-like appearance. When travelling through this part of the desert, travellers must account for exhaustion and must be adequately prepared.
## Landmark 4 - Cornucopia Streak
Shaped by what seems to be very convenient natural generation, the Cornucopia Streak is the home of [[Zal'Aata/Zal'Aata]]. This lush streak of foliage provides an ideal environment for many different species that have made their homes here. This environment particularly provides a plentiful biosphere for [[Hunter Settlement/Auroch]], which are hunted by the [[Badawi Hunter Tribe]].
