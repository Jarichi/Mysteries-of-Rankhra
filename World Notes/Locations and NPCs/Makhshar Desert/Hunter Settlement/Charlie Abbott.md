otherwise known as "Bleeder". I unfirtunately need to make him a deeper character :sob:

## Without Hunter tribe memories

Charlie was born outside the city of Zal'Aata; instead being born in atown in the Cornucopia Streak, namely [[zzvfgys]]. He grew up in a reasonably well-off family, who owned a luxurious butchery, being the one who needed to take over the butchery after his parents would pass, or move. On some reasonably recent day, they somehow got into contact with a vampire, or some [[bard vampire]] who harnessed the concept of connection to connect their status of vampire to Charlie, without the disadvantages of being a nightwalker. This makes Charlie one of the first "natural" cases of a daywalker, though he does experience bloodlust.

After either being exiled from his village, or leaving voluntarily, he ended up in the [[Badawi Hunter Tribe]], where he could be accepted as a vampire, at the cost of losing certain memories when leaving the tribe. His memory loss causes him to forget that he is a vampire.
