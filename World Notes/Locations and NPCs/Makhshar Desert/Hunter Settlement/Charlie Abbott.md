otherwise known as "Bleeder". I unfirtunately need to make him a deeper character :sob:

## Without Hunter tribe memories

Charlie was born outside the city of Zal'Aata; instead being born in atown in the Cornucopia Streak, namely [[zzvfgys]]. He grew up in a reasonably well-off family, who owned a luxurious butchery, being the one who needed to take over the butchery after his parents would pass, or move. On some reasonably recent day, they somehow got into contact with a vampire, or some [[Lysandre]] who harnessed the concept of connection to connect their status of vampire to Charlie, without the disadvantages of being a nightwalker. This makes Charlie one of the first "natural" cases of a daywalker, though he does experience bloodlust.

After either being exiled from his village, or leaving voluntarily, he ended up in the [[Badawi Hunter Tribe]], where he could be accepted as a vampire, at the cost of losing certain memories when leaving the tribe. His memory loss causes him to forget that he is a vampire, which is just lowkey kinda funny. This makes it a little more likely to be exiled, instead of leaving volutariy, because why attempt to return when you were purposefully sent away.

After meeting up with Marilyne and receiving a blood stone from her, he made it into a piece of jewelrery, but does not know WHY he needs it. The bracelet suppresses bloodlust and coupled with the fact that he also does not experience daywalking sympromes, he fully and utterly believes he is a vampire.
