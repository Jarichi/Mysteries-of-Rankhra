#group 
Base of ops is within [[Badawi Hunter Settlement]].  They have been known for following some sort of [[Badawi|owlcat]], who is the Concept of Exploration

The tribe is not lead by anybody and exists as an anarchist body. It mainly takes care of its own benefits and does not allow outsiders to enter without accompaniment of one of the members. The tribe only talks to its members, and visitors need to direct their questions to the guide in order to talk to them


#### Origin Mythos
The Badawi Hunters originated eons ago, when a small group of hunter colleagues got lost within the desert sands. They had almost given up their hope of survival when a small clearing in the desert storm appeared, with a small owlcat curiously looking at them, beckoning to follow it. The friends followed the owlcat - now named Badawi - and managed to get rescued from the sandstorm. Feeling like they were saved by a mystical being, the friends decided to swear an oath to the creature, binding their fates to it and deciding to go wherever this Badawi went.

The memories you make while staying in the tribe will generally not leave the tribe. As such, nomads that leave the tribe are not able to talk about their experiences here and are also not allowed to write down their thoughts. As such, if you need a way to actually remember things you go through within, you'd need a way to secretly send or write the information elsewhere. One noteable exception is a certain group, that was allowed to partly keep their memories.

A noteable fact about the hunter tribe is that Bleeder - One of the important figures of the tribe - appears to be a Dawnwalker vampire.
