The Circle of the Moon, located in a difficult-to-access valley in the midst of the [[Conru Mountains]] is a community of Druids of a large variety of races. While its existence is known in the public lore of the continent, what the Circle protects, what secrets they hide and what their history is is not known to outsiders.
