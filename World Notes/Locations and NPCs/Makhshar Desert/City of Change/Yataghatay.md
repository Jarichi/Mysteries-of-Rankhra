#location 
### Etymology
Derived from the Arabic word of change and mirrored because I enjoy stealing lore from pepople who write better than I do.
In Zal'Aata, this city is known as Yatag'Aata.
Formerly known as the City of Change.

### Origin and General Information
Yataghatay was founded an unknown period ago. Based on Drawings from this founding period, the shape of the city was specially determined in order to represent the glyph of "Hold Person". Scholars theorise it might have had something to do with capturing the [[Concept of Change]] within the confines of the city for unknown reasons.
It is nearly exclusively inhabited by changelings, who are most likely attracted to the city's changing nature.
