During each period, the city exhibits a certain theme, where all inhabitants speak a certain language, are dressed in a certain style and behave a certain way. So far, no pattern has repeated itself, yet styles may be combined.
Scholars are investigating whether these styles may be prophetic in nature, however, no conclusive evidence has been raised.
