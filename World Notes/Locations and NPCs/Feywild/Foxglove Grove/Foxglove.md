Foxglove is a tulip-shaped flower that only grows in the Feywild. This flower emits a strong scent that smells slightly sour for inhabitants of the Mortal Plane, but has a very pleasantly colourful smell for inhabitants of the Feywild. This flower mostly grows in [[../Foxglove Grove]], but also appears in other areas.

This flower is very rarely sold by merchants in Zal'Aata. These merchants get these flowers by coincidentally finding seeds near peculiar areas with magical influences, almost as if they appeared out of thin air. 

They cultivate these seeds by supplying them with a constant surge of magic to create similar conditions as in the Feywild. Flowers grown in the Mortal Plane wither much faster than flowers grown in the Feywild.

maybe some hidden potion effect that only happens in the feywild

Fogglove grown near Rankhra and Janib'Rankhra seem to have the same properties as foxglove grown in the Feywild, but this influence returns to normal if they are removed from the area.
