# Description
Conceived by the [[Shoka Engineering Collective]], this dome was created as a means to limit the effects of light pollution due to the nocturnal lifestyle of Zal'Aata's denizens. It emulates the current position of the stars - with a few additions - and provides a serene and creative way of viewing the stards amidst the city's nocturnal glow.

### Functionality
The Aether Firmament is not only used as an observatory, but also provides a way for communication across the city. After using a special arcane device known as a [[Comet]], users can transmit any message through the heavens. This message manifests as a shining star travelling through the heavens towards its destination, after which the recipient receives the message as either a telepathic transmission, or as a physical letter.

It is also the [[Constellation]] responsible for the communication across the entire city. Most comets are routed through here. This constellation is created and managed using the Asteroid located in the distribution center.

### Context
This innovative way of communication provides a low-cost means of long-distance communication. It also serves as a communal service and provides an unique experience to the city.

#### DM Details
This dome is seen as a magical artifact that constantly casts Sending.
