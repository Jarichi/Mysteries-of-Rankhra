containing true lore because all of the lore that the party found during the exploration does not tell the whole story, matter of fcat, tells a completely wrong story.
#object 
the more the book is actively studied, the more the language is ingrained into the beings of the readers.
ever-changing script but the meaning is constant. (combination of all of the concepts by the god of creation)

book is hidden in a secret room that is opened by the BBEG after the party kills them, in order to clarify that what they did was a huge mistake


insight roles every tme th ebook is studied

do something, after obtaining the book, that the time is catching up. Everything that is foreign to the temple is slowly fading away and aging at an accelerating rate. BUT artifacts that the partyty may have that came from either inside the temple OR from the ancients, stay exactly the same. (maybe some magical glow), roll perception and arcana to increase check succes.

for example, some necklace by a perty membert with an unclear backstory does not age to add depth

the book contains the REAL telling of the history and not the unclear and subjective telling of the history dound by that research guild team.
