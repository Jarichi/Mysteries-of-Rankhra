[[Concepts]]
Concept of Growth:
- this manifests itself in plant growth, and literal tall creatures
- But also self growth
- the city in which this concept resides is very spiritual an citizens spent most of their time meditating and connecting to other planes of existance
- the city can be situated on the highest mountain, symbolizing growth

Concept of connection
- All citizens are telepathically linked and can sense wat others are thinking with one look in their eyes
- they are also connected to the elements and when they are physically in contact with them they know their "memories?" (like the path the river has followed, the materials something is made out of etc.)
- they also have established portals to other planes
- they made all the pathways connecting other cities.

concept of transformation
- place of wild magic
- in this city it is believed that every change brings something anew
- the inhabitants all have wild magic in some form
- the city/temple/forest/etc. itself is a giant maze where the corridors change alot
- the citizens are mostly changelings and shifters. Other creatures know the disguise self spell

concept of exploration
- unlike other concepts, this concept is ever-moving and cannot be stationary
- this concept also has a physical form and can be stored and touched
- the tribe that holds this concept currently is a nomad tribe that lets itself be leaded by the movement of the concept
- this concept is "curious" to unexplored areas and will never be at the same place twice

concept of reflection
- (stolen from honkai :3 )
- this concept is literal reflection and thus cannot be touched
- when looking at this concept it appears as a mirror
- when close to the concept you are compelled to reflect on your deeds
- it also helps you find answers you were (or didnt know you were) looking for

concept of Whimsy
- this concept is inherently magical and has no physical form
- it manifests in colors, music and movement
- it is linked to creativity and joy
- citizens of the city can weave magic and create spells, therefore one of the most magical school is located here and all spells come from this school
