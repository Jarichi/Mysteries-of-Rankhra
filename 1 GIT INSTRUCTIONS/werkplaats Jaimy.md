Alle ideeÃ«n komen hierin met Backlinks naar de betreffende file
Chris kopieert deze veranderingen naar de goede file
dit is ook een goede manier om de veranderingen te screenen om te zien of ze passen in de wereld

Cactus species
- this cactus is known for their changing colors and mostly grows on the outskirts of the city of change
- it has hallucinatory effects
- (maybe let the party drink an innocent drink and make them hallucinate something that isn't there or something that is there. (zoek maar op "Fonta genshin") voor de general vibe van het drankje)
	- misschien gemaakt door een side villain


Gentle death
- When Death was formed it was dark. Endless darkness without meaning. Death thought this was who they were, Just endless darkness without meaning in the world. Then suddenly there was a light, the light shone through the darkness and formed into a sphere. It gave meaning to the darkness and Death. 
- The sphere told Death that they are the last thing seen by every living being but never the start. The last period in the book of life, the final flame of the candle of birth, the final breath of the world and the guide of the dead, but most importantly the last memory of the brain.
- Death finally had endless meaning and vowed to guide every being in their final moments. As Life bestows choice and freedom in life, Death bestows a final choice in death
- After centuries of Death and more population, Death never lost their vow and continues to guide creatures until they can finally guide themselves.

Misschien voor combat een d6? rollen op een table als iemand dood gaat? 
1. Small natural occurrence
2. Send support (gives uneasy feeling,  roll WIS check if they send backup)
3. Say goodbye to loved ones
4. give party a buff/debuff depending on alignment of the dead
5. 5 Temporary hitpoints for the enemy/party
6. Advantage/Disadvantage op eerstvolgende roll

Crafted life
- When Life was formed it was bright. illuminated light with so much meaning. Life thought this was who they were, illuminated brightness bringing meaning to the world. Then suddenly there was a darkness, the darkness cut through the brightness and formed into a sphere. it gave emptiness to the brightness and Life.
- The sphere told Life that they are the first thing seen by every living being but never the last. The first capital in the book of life, the spark igniting the candle of birth, the first breath of the world and the guide of the living, but most importantly the constant memories of the brain.
- Life saw their finality and vowed to guide every being in their life. As Death bestows one final choice, Life bestows freedom an choice throughout life.
- After centuries of Life and more population, Life slowly began to lose their vow and saw less and less meaning. This resulted in Life not caring for most creatures but only those who they seemed worthy until They are finally guided by Death.
