Cactus species
- this cactus is known for their changing colors and mostly grows on the outskirts of the city of change
- it has hallucinatory effects
- (maybe let the party drink an innocent drink and make them hallucinate something that isn't there or something that is there. (zoek maar op "Fonta genshin") voor de general vibe van het drankje)
	- misschien gemaakt door een side villain


## Introductie Aki
the party enters a shop where stuff is being sold. When they look into the room they see lots of red silk robes and decorations hanging from the ceiling (Red = category of shop maybe?)
When they look at the counter they see a fox sleeping in a basket and the shopkeeper standing and greeting them. "hello travelers how can I help you today?" (cue uitleg van de waren die verkocht worden) after the shopkeep explained his wares, the pendant hanging around his neck starts glowing (starcaster) he says "excuse me, I have to take care of something. My assistent will further help you" the shopkeep walks to a backroom and leaves the party standing in the shop. the party then chooses what to do.
- Stealing?
	- the fox wakes up and robin introduces his character and rollplays the reaction on the stealing party
- Waiting?
	- Encourage them to investigate the shop and talk to the fox --> Aki wakes up and reacts on the situation
- Wanting to leave?
	- the shopkeep returns and wakes the fox with a light scolding about not doing his job --> Aki apologizes and greets the party

after this Aki joins the party because something happens outside the shop and the party and Aki go investigate

# npc
- Water genasi bartender: Martin Isle ("Martini" get it?)
	- measures exact ounces in the drinks and stirs drinks perfectly due to their water abilities
	- Sometimes experiments with drinks so you don't always get what you order
	- Flaw: very messy, their bar station is always full of glasses, ingrediënts and colorful straws
- Oath of the sea paladin (Salazar Coldwind (real name: reggi buer))
	- Always in the café with a glas of water/other light beverage
	- when talked to he speaks of his adventures at the great sea but he exxagerates these stories
		- i once defeated a kraken (it was a small squid)
		- A storm killed half my men (it didn't, they just left his ship because the paladin is a bad captain)
		- My trading routes are famous because i'm the best (he isn't, and he doesn't have a trading route. He just smuggled a crate with fish over the border.)
