end essieion
quite happy lots of unplanned

history on the names what they mught remember

Significant events that happened
- The party got a burner comet from Vadan
- Marilyne discovered that sunburn, and other disadvantages from the sun do not seem to affect her as strongly as they do outside of the city
	- By extension, only Verdant, Semyon and the party know about her vampirism.
- Accepted a mission - Investigate the newspaper agency
	- Reward: 550GP
- (They have given Salazar the letter from Balthazar) they are confronting Salazar on the adventures of Balthasar lmao
- They have taken on some disguises, provided to them by Semyon and Verdant.
	- Distinguished schoolboy "Kees" - Ratreonus
	- Foxo with pink furry collar - Fathimeh
	- delivery man Peter - Hunter
	- Office siren - Marilyne
- They have met up with Telas, who was also on a mission to infiltrate the newspaper distribution centre.
	- She has given the party the name "Sabrina", who is the receptionist and supervisor of the bottom floor of the newspaper distribution
	- She does not know who Sabrina's supervisors are, but suspects they have something to do with the Shoka Engineering Collective.
	- She also is unaware why the party was not informed of her mission, however it is safe to assume that this is because of knowledge separation.
- Aki visited Raphaella's study in the basement, which is in an aluminium room (aluminium blocks magic), and she appeared to study how comets work, how they are connected and magical artifacts in general. Her motivations are unknown.
- Aki also visited the conference room on the first floor, and discovered a folder of meeting minutes. The minutes are written in an unintelligible script, except for the names of the attendants:
	- Everon Lunares - magic schoool
	- Cedar Zendikar - biologist
	- Alys Nakayaru - someone from where aki comes from 
	- Ra'Sheema Zal-Hiera - cult leader
- Sabrina was ambushed, and tightened to the desk by Maryline and Ratronus, after attempting to coerce her into relinquishing her supervision to Maryline. She attempted to do this by cleverly using Illusory Script to create a foolproof permission slip.
- Investigating the central, large comet - also known as an Asteroid - provided information that the communication net is divided into a number of separate networks, called constellations
	- City constellation - Routes all general-use Comets of Zal'Aata through this Asteroid.
	- Research group's constellation - Appears to manage the connection of the comets through a completely distinct  network. The location of its Asteroid is unknown
	- Some different constellation - Appears to be an independent network, specifically made for burner comets, known as Meteors.
- Ratronus has broadcasted the following message to the city constellation using the central Asteroid, in Thieves' Cant: "Abandon your post - everything is a lie"

### The newspaper mission - END
- After completing the Newspaper mission, the party goes to a bar in the First Domain
- They discussed their findings and shared their information about what they have found.
	- Mentioning the names found in the minutes yielded recognition by nearly all party members;
		- Aki recognised Alys Nakayaru as being a reasonably prominent figure in her hometown;
		- Most everyone recognised Everon Lunares as being the principle of the magic school;
		- Most everyone recognised Cedar Zendikar as being an acclaimed biologist who routinely investigates the flora and fauna found near certain spots in the desert;
		- Ra'Sheema was recognised by Marilyne as being a sect leader devoted to Rankhra.
	- The barkeeper of this bar is a changeling originating from Yataghatay, the City of Change.
		- Marilyne drank his blood
		- Ratronus stole 499 gold
	- The minutes are written in a magical script that can only be read by designated persons or by uttering a passphrase.
- Ratronus opened up slightly about his past, speaking about a prominent loved one that betrayed him for... reasons.
### The Vision - parallel
- The party started heading back to Lettered Lamenting, when Marilyne was hit with a vision and went to her house.
	- Party offered to go with her however Marilyne insisted that they'd let her do this alone.
	- The vision showed flashes of information about a person - known as the Lady of River's Red - heading to Makhshar Desert for unknown reasons.
	- Another flash showed the Lady arriving in an unusual location, where she interacted with some sort of divinity
		- A shallow lake, perfectly level water, with a cave in the centre whose reflection is perfectly retained in the water. The atmospheric light seemed almost a steel blue.
		- The divine presence spoke from the reflection itself, directly to the Lady.
			- ...Redemption...A task...protect us...
	- The final flash showed the Lady splitting into two metaphysical halves; one of which was dark and one of which was light.
	- Magical energy intensified by a lot, when Marilyne's bone started to react, and protect her from the energy, after which she was kicked out of the vision, clutching the bone.
### The Alley - parallel
- The party without Marilyne passed through the alley.............................................
- And ended up in an inbetween zone, filled with dark smoke
- The perceptive Ratronus noticed a figure standing in the middle of it, and a dark presence who's attention was focused on them, but also partly focused on the party.
- Upon interacting with this person using a clever mage hand combined with Aki's well-placed dancing lights, it was revealed that they were Fredrick - the person who had already been tortured and killed/pacified by an unknown shadow creature.
- Fredrick attempted to speak, but the only words he could utter were "Ideas are corrupted, everything will change." in the same language as The Book of Life - Copy found in Janib'Rankhra.
	- The party does not know yet what this language is called.
- Upon hearing this, Ratronus decided to whisper, and managed to communicate with Fredrick;
	- While he heard the same words spoken by a magical influence, he could hear Fredrick say: "*The Lady* is here, save me."
- Ratronus asked Fredrick what ideas he was talking about, when the dark presence coalesced into a figure.
- Hunter took his aim and shot the best shot he ever has, only to find out this manifestation was not a real, physical, being.
	- However, it is unclear whether or not he actually did not achieve anything...
- A brief exchange revealed that the shadow being could not, for some reason, understand what Fredrick had been saying.
- The party told them what Fredrick said, and the being asked for more information and is aware that they work for the Research Group.
	- It also seemed to have learned who they are.
- Upon inability to explain further, the figure exploded Fredrick to avoid his words from reaching other people
	- When Fredrick died, the same death divinity briefly appeared, but could not do anything.
- The dark smoke transformed into a maw with sharp teeth, and intense red eyes, but JUST before the party was eaten, the same energy present in Marilyne's vision interfered, and the party was ejected from the alleyway.
	- It can be safely assumed that this happened at the same moment as Marilyne's bone reacting to the energy.

	- the city of change (which must only be visited after clearing the trail)
