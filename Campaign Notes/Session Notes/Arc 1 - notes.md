## Session 1
joris roll perception
20 - describe tunnel

starting gold 125gp.

roll athletics

joris runs into the garage and daan rolss perception

daan notices him but continues working

joris decides to be a bit more quiet.

daan receives the letter from aki in fox shape

joris pulls his rapier in response to daan who was read the letter. and says dammit in the 

joris quietly opens the door and sees daan. He decides to drop a wrench and interacts with daan.

joris goves him 5 gold to kind of haggle to overnacht with him.
Daan rereads the letter and shows daan the symbol

Joris introduces himself as ratronus and shows a faked id. The name is barteljaap.

Daan distrusts joris and introduces himself as Hunter. He grabs his warhammer to intimidate. They decide to leave the garage

while they leave the garage they see a billbord. Hunter doesnt know what the posters mean and Aki junps off the shoulder and changes into her human form

Aki tells hunter about the posters. Ratronus wanted to remember i fhe saw a human change into an animal. He heard about this being a thing but never saw a fox change into a human before.

Ratronus is hesitant but shakes Aki's hand. She asks him about his rat form.

they head towards the tavern and don't notice the alleyway shenanigans

only hunter hesitates before entering the tavern.

they enter the tavern and decide to roll perception

Aki heads towards the barkeeper and pays 10 gp for the strongest drink.
hunter orders 2 beer for himself and ratronus. (5gp)

they ask him about his personal details: martin comes from outside of the city. 
Aki is tipsy (-2 on charisma saves)

aki spends 11gp and goes to Sasha and Martin.

Verdant (he/him) gets recognised and ratronus calls aki a pet

chrone enters the building in spider form

Chron climbs the bar and changes into his druid form.

ratronus notes the impostance of the spider hole

Chrone uses is full govenment legal name and verdant is happy to see him. Makes a funny remark for the session.

ratronus gets the most escapable chair.

verdant asks them to describe their abilities
he also asks them abput the invitation

the giant eagle steals the letter and verdant is shocked at reading the letter 
(the party doesnt trust verdant which is understandable)

aki and hunters get 300gp and the rest 200gp.

verdant apologises for the letter and sends them towards the sewers

(went a totally different direction than I intended.)

Hunter gets dragged out of the room and they need to go to the sewers.

might write verdant as an unknowing owner who is being manipulated by Semyon.

- going to the sewers

aki opens the manhole cover and casts fox fire.

ratronus follows hesitantly and as the last person in the group

aki opens the door and the humanoid female has a dirty face (mary)

they move on and get at some combat area. there is a symbol

aki enters fox form and rolls stealth
Chron walks towards Salina (hidden) and notices her ears

- meeting salina
she crawls out of the hiding place and trusts them.

she tells them where marcus and other went
and talks to the group
nootes that verdant is extremely chaotic

marcus, fredric

marcus took fredrick with him and slaina could hide.

salina doesnt get trusted and offers to walk towards marcus' lair

the same symbol of the letter is on the door of marcus' lair.

aki sneaks into the house and opens the locked door

and aki also rolls investigation in the drawer. drawer contains a diary entry of Marcus which has the information about semyon, and verdant possibly.being manipulated by him.

ratronus is panicking and looking around, since he learned about an overlord. He walsk out of the building

salina is getting pinned against the wall and gets slapped by ratronus who walked into the building again.

marcus must die

ratronus tells them not in lots of detail that marcus might get a position of power and decides to ensnare Salina, in order to bring her back to Verdant.

before this, they get shot with an arrow by the healer npc

get shot with an arrow which misses Salina.

combat order:
healer, chron, wizard, aki, hunter, marcus, rat


(healer shot the arrow cliumsily) and misses

chron casts summon beast: summons a brown bear near the wiz and healer

bear attacks the healer for 1d8+4+2 for 13 (non lethal). Healer gets knocked out
also goes into wild shape

wizard teleports away casts mage arrow for 12dmg on twan bear wild shape

hunter shoots with musket on the wizard for 13 dmg. Wizard dies 

marcus shoots 7dmg on Hunter

rat uses silvery barbs to attack the wizard.

End session 1

## Session 2
[[Hunter Back.pdf]], [[Ratronus Front.pdf]], [[Aki Front.pdf]], [[Chrone Front.pdf]]

Session Recap
-kinda accurate except that Joris thinks that Marcus has brought Salina along to serve as bait or osmething (which is kinda wrong)

letter caches on fire due to Parting Gift

aki teases ratronus

aki shows ashes to salina and she says good riddance

rat asks chron about Semyon but he doesn't know the name
	correction that Semyons  name has never been dropped except in the letter. Only rat knows about that name
they encounter the shade (Manifeststion of Rubae)

chron arcana roll 14, sees no school but knows a concentration spell is being cast
	rat and aki also roll too low


chron wants to communicate and asks what they are doing. No response


aki sees the attacks spell and stands next to the person (fredrick) who is being enchanted.

Rubae prepares the teleport spell since she doesnt want to engage with
entangle misses
	Ratronus silvery barbs but I roll higher. Results in no entangle

Aki gets advantage and hits the shade
	4 slashing dmg, HITS THE SHADE AS A GOOEY MESS BUT DOES DAMAGE THE SHADE.

DC is 17 btw
	Hunter misses and hits a bird and eplodes the bird

Rubae teleports away without saying much
They saved Frederic
	Aki wake slap but chrone pulls him back


aki shows marcus' ashes
frederic responds kinda like wtf


rat offers fredrick a drink
rat also gets +20 gp

--prepping to return to the research group

perception bonuis

perception check +20 dc. Ratronus makes it
	thieves cant on the previously visited house states that somebidy died. Functions as a memorial.
	thieves cant isn now flemish

- In research group

aki trips, and treats the entire bar

Chron immediately walks towards Verdant

Hunter comments on the story Martin Isla was telling
	"It is completely wrong lmao"

aki pays 13.5gp for all beer

- to verdant

Hunter stands in the corner

everyone else sits down

Verdant asks how the mission wdent
	Aki explains the mission
	shows marcus, verdant reacts quite calmly
Aki tells about marcus
	Ratronus is very angry with this,  so is Hunter

Verdant did not expect this and apologises.
Reward is upped to 400 gp/person

Verdant used a Comet to send Telas to the site to retrieve bodies and evidence

Verdant tells the party about his hypothesis that everyone has some connections to the temple.

verdant explains the new mission
	Gather info about Rankhra 
	(I did not specify a gold pieces amount for some reason and I forgot...)


rat and hunter ask about semyon
	verdant has known smeyon for 200 yrs
	they tell them thay semyon might betray verdant. Verdant will keep it in mind but doesn't really seem convinced 
	semyon has a different job perhaps
	the letter paper ashes is given to verdant

rat implies overlord as marcus

ratronus leaves the room to allow private convo with Hunter
	semyon added the letter contents to the letter sent to Hunter 
	The paper of the letter is quite generic and might have been used in a newspaper. Therefore not retractable to anyone

- filler
they go to the alley and arrive in the ciry

Aki immediately goes towards the centroscopia looking for a botanist

Ratronus RUNS towards the temple looking for manholes
	Manhole is near the magic school

Chrone makes a round around the temple

Hunter goes towards the armory

Ratronus attempes to open the manhole
	Magic lock on manhole so unopenable

Chron perception 23
	History check on inscription on Rankhra
	recognises owlcat but doesn't know the meaning. This only has meaning for Hunter


Hunter enters the clothing store armory and throws the door closed

Aki wants to buy foxglove for 200gp from a botanist
	Aki wnts to bribe the merchant with information about where to get it
	100gp
	she receives a free  flower which is...
		Foxglove :3

Aki steals the flower tee hee and lies to the group about stealing it hehe

rat wins the stealth check to prevent embarrasment about not being able to open the cover. and the party doesnt see the manhole cover
	Investigation failure


the person that was initially  looking at the temple is walking towards the party. He's a random human who is not significant for now
	he went into the desert and saw some pillars
	about an hour walking distance from Zal'Aata
	

ratronus knows about the pillars and the temple. Heard about it from his backstory. So does Chron

they fast travel and arrive at the temple

aki and rat recognise the temple.

The pillars depict 4 significant things for each party member backstory.

hunter succeeds his history check and knows the name of the owlcat; Bahath

Rat knows the organisation by name
(Mycelio)

Aki knows foxglove

Chron knows birch elf

rat organises the party towards the pillar and they instantly solve the puzzle

eratronus rolls investigation if they are being followed DC 15
	9, 5, 10, 9. Uncertain if they are or aren't followed. (Spoiler: they are not being followed I just like giving them anxiety)
	foxfire is being cast for the people without darkvision.
Temple contains a Book of Life and Death (posted in dnd channel).

they read the book and absorb the lore.
	bad at giving a summary so they read it on their owrn

divine sense was cast
	hallow spell on book, no undeads and fiends, 

The book is picked up and read...

END OF SESSION

Notes for next session:
Book is a trigger for the opening of a hidden door.
Cynthia's character will be introduced upon arrival in the city.
Beginning of next session will be mainly exploration of the city and speaking with NPCs to get more info.
Also introduces a different way of getting missions by means of the city billboard and newspaper, so the party is ultimately reporting to Verdant but not dependent on him to get missions.

---
### Session conclusions
- Glad I had seperate roleplay sessions with Cynthia since she wanted to roleplay, and Twan is honestly good at RP as well which is very very fun!
- Generally very happy about this session, though I feel like the pacing and the npc dialogue are something I may need to improve upon.
- The improv this time was very good, they thought I actually fully thought this out which is most certainly not the case.
- Happy with the on-the-fly change to change Bleeder into a vampire who has been accepted as a true Badawi hunter.
- One thing I do need to kinda pay attention to and perhaps try to control is the lack of focus for some players when they are not directly involved in conversation stuff, since other people get to shine as well.
- I do need to keep track of inspiration moments for funny roleplaying, and I might give Chrone and at least Marilyne inspiration. However, I think that perhaps I need to keep track whenever somebody interacts with their backstory.
- It's funny to me that apparently nobody really made the connection between Hunt*er* and all other -er people in the hunter tribe.

In conclusion, I am extremely happy with where the story is going and am looking forward to the end of the arc. The party seems to trust Marilyne quite well which is very good, only Chrone might suspect that she's a vampire but as long as Bleeder gives them no reason to distrust vamps, she's safe.

I also enjoy preventing Chrone from dominating combat by simply denying his abilities of the OP wild shape (moonbeam) and feel like I'm letting the party shine during their combat encounters.
