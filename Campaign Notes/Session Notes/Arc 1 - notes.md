joris quietly opens the door and sees daan. He decides to drop a wrench and interacts with daan.

joris goves him 5 gold to kind of haggle to overnacht with him.
Daan rereads the letter and shows daan the symbol

Joris introduces himself as ratronus and shows a faked id. The name is barteljaap.

Daan distrusts joris and introduces himself as Hunter. He grabs his warhammer to intimidate. They decide to leave the garage

while they leave the garage they see a billbord. Hunter doesnt know what the posters mean and Aki junps off the shoulder and changes into her human form

Aki tells hunter about the posters. Ratronus wanted to remember i fhe saw a human change into an animal. He heard about this being a thing but never saw a fox change into a human before.

Ratronus is hesitant but shakes Aki's hand. She asks him about his rat form.

they head towards the tavern and don't notice the alleyway shenanigans

only hunter hesitates before entering the tavern.

the giant eagle steals the letter and verdant is shocked at reading the letter 
(the party doesnt trust verdant which is understandable)

aki and hunters get 300gp and the rest 200gp.

verdant apologises for the letter and sends them towards the sewers

(went a totally different direction than I intended.)

Hunter gets dragged out of the room and they need to go to the sewers.

might write verdant as an unknowing owner who is being manipulated by Semyon.
