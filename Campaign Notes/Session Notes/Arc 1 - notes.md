daan notices him but continues wroking
joris decides to be a bit more quiet.

daan receives the letter from aki in fox shape

jpris pulls his rapier in response to daan who was read the letter. and says dammit in the 

joris quietly opens the door and sees daan. He decides to drop a wrench and interacts with daan.

joris goves him 5 gold to kind of haggle to overnacht with him.
Daan rereads the letter and shows daan the symbol

Joris introduces himself as ratronus and shows a faked id. The name is barteljaap.

Daan distrusts joris and introduces himself as Hunter. He grabs his warhammer to intimidate. They decide to leave the garage

while they leave the garage they see a billbord. Hunter doesnt know what the posters mean and Aki junps off the shoulder and changes into her human form

Aki tells hunter about the posters. Ratronus wanted to remember i fhe saw a human change into an animal. He heard about this being a thing but never saw a fox change into a human before.

Ratronus is hesitant but shakes Aki's hand. She asks him about his rat form.

they head towards the tavern and don't notice the alleyway shenanigans

only hunter hesitates before entering the tavern.

they enter the tavern and decide to roll perception

ratronus gets the most escapable chair.

verdant asks them to describe their abilities
he also asks them abput the invitation

the giant eagle steals the letter and verdant is shocked at reading the letter 
(the party doesnt trust verdant which is understandable)

aki and hunters get 300gp and the rest 200gp.

verdant apologises for the letter and sends them towards the sewers

(went a totally different direction than I intended.)

Hunter gets dragged out of the room and they need to go to the sewers.

might write verdant as an unknowing owner who is being manipulated by Semyon.

- going to the sewers

aki opens the manhole cover and casts fox fire.

ratronus follows hesitantly and as the last person in the group

aki opens the door and the humanoid female has a dirty face (mary)

she tells them where marcus and other went
and talks to the group
nootes that verdant is extremely chaotic

marcus, fredric

marcus took fredrick with him and slaina could hide.

salina doesnt get trusted and offers to walk towards

the same letter symbol of the letter is on the symbol.

aki sneaks into the house and opens the locked door

and aki also rolls investigation in the drawer. drawer contains a diary entry of Marcus which has the information he has.

ratronus is panicking and looking around, since he learned about an overlord. He walsk out of the building

salina is getting pinned against the wall and gets slapped by ratronus who walked into the building again.
