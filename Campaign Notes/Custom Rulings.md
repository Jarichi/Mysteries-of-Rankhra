# General DM - Party
## Leveling and Stats
- Upon leveling, players may decide to increase their HP by rolling their hit dice, and adding their CON bonus to the roll. This provides an opportunity to get more HP when leveling. Players may also decide to play it safe and take their hit dice average (divide hit dice maximum by 2 and add 1) + CON for their HP increase
- If a player receives two proficiencies, due to their class, or level up/feat, the DM may decide to give this player an expertise for this skill. Note that, if the DM declines an expertise, the player is allowed to pick a different available option.

# Classes and Races
## Druid (Circle of the Moon)
- Every third level, starting from level 3, increases the maximum allowed challenge rating for a wild shape.

- A moon druid may begin the game with 2 wild shapes. The total amount of allowed wild shapes is equal to 2 + WIS.

# (UA) Spells
- [this will be updated after player discussion]
	- Points to discuss:
		- Puppet, and by extension the way opportunity attacks are triggered and movement is consumed.

- Puppet will be changed
