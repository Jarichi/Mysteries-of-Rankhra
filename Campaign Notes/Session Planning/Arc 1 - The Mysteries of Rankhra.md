This document will contain details and summaries of the planned action happening in the first arc.
## Session 1
- meeting the party
- Ratronus was running from a 3rd domain goon group that was chasing him and meets Aki and Daan this way. Most likely will start from his perspective
- Ratronus, escaping from his backstory significant event, he left the Third Domain and enters the First Domain, still in shock from what happened. He will haphazardly run into a store and will interact with Hunter and Aki this way. I'll first spend some time describing the setting for him and start the introduction afterwards.

- Aki is in a store as an assistent, character introduction
		- Works at Hunter's Garage shop.
		- they are already familiar with each other
		- THE PARTY DOES NOT KNONW AT THIS POINT AKI IS A KITSUNE
		- Aki sits on Hunter's shoulder and they head out
		
	- Hunter receives a letter via his Comet. Aki has the comet in her mouth and gives this to Hunter. The Comet materialises a [[Shoka to Hunter - Letter|letter]] from the Shoka Engineering Collective.
	- the Shoka letter writes about that the sponsorship money gets relinquished unless they figure out a way to investigate the temple for certain goals. It also writes about there being more information on the Billboard. Billboards contains a poster about some clothing store, a potion shop and a research group that provides protection and safe housing for new members who would like to research the temple.
	- This is the reason for Ratronus and Hunter to join the group.
- they head out and go towards the research group.
	- noteably walk through an alleyway, and I will pause. You go through an alleyway... ... ... And you arrive at a tavern.   
	- Chrone is already a member of the research group and has already gathered some esteem, and is the reason why the party even gets the mission in the first place.
		- Chrone arrives in his wild shape (spooder) coincidentally at the same time.
		- preceprtion roll for seeing the hole in the roof.

- Joining research group [[Lettered Lamenting]]
	- Verdant introduces themselves and answers the most of their questions
	- They are allowed to speak with the NPCs in the area/
	- After introductions, Verdant asks them to join the research group, and immediately gives them a mission that lets the party go into the 3rd domain.
- Receiving Mission
	- Mission entails a search-and-rescue(?) of a number of former members of the research group, who left the research group without disclosing crucial information
		- This also immediately sets the stakes for deserting the group.
	- They are also lead to the sewers near the cafe, and are notably not told about the fact that money is useless in the 3rd domain, either by way of Verdant saying they needn't worry about that.
		- Note: they are not obliged to enter the sewers immediately, and are of course allowed to wander the city, or even go to the temple.



- Meeting person 1 - Salina
	- Upon arriving in the 3rd domain, they are allowed to read the [[Mission Instructions no.1|message]]
	- Verdant gave them, that contains instructions on getting towards that person's current location. If the letter is read multiple times, the location changes dynamically.
	- This section will be very roleplay and insight heavy and lets the party exeplore the Third Domain. They will need to go through several areas to get to Salina and gives them a chance to explore the world and for me to see how they play when they are given limited instructions and implications.
		- This will need to be properly thought out by means of some sort of map containing several points of interest.
		- I am expecting this to take time.

	- Layout of the third domain will be linked in a file.
	- Following directions of course leads them to a sort of ambush of a small criminal gang, who attacks the party and lets them have some combat fun.
	- Salina will join the party and is a level 5 cleric who can help with the combat.
- might split this by inserting a return mission.

- Meeting Person 2 - Marcus
	- Marcus is currently an Overlord and is also hostile against the party. This will be the main combat event.
	- [[Marcus vs. Party]]
	- Wether Marcus lives or dies, they need to bring him to the research group.

--end session 1:
[[Arc 1 - notes]]

###### Session conclusions
Party:
- Verdant is not to be trusted
- Salina is not to be trusted but maybe
- Marcus must die (he died)
- Chrone may not entirely be trusted.
- Semyon got namedropped
- They may or may not trust anything with connections to the research group.
DM:
- Should keep stories consistent.
- Try to show off character's strength more (e.g. melee combat with Aki for her paladin abilities)
- make characters that can definitely be trusted
- may need to rewrite most of my planning and define plot points.
- ---
## Session 2


- after marcus' death, the letter by marcus will be incinerated due to Gentle Death death wish.
	- I sure hoppe they kept notes >:3
	- the filler combat NPC's death will be remembered by some house in the impromptu village DC 20+. Probably at the same house that that one Anna woman lived in.

- Meeting Person 3 - Frederic
	- The party will continue looking for Frederic and will probably just find some sort of trail towards him, OR EVEN BETTER, he will simply run into the party panicking because he needs to get back to Verdant.
		- Hopefully, the accounts of people trusting Verdant will lead to an increase in trust for the party. ANYWAY,
	- Before frederic can finish his sentence he gets killed by Rubae after which the party I suppose may use an action to do something i guess. Rubae immediately tries to teleport away, but 
	- Frederic dies and wishes for Rubae to remain in place: teleport fails momentarily
		- "Ahh, that human really *had* to interfere after its death." before teleporting away.
			- If the party ask Salina about Gentle Death, she will reveal some information about this since she's a member of the Sanctum of Death.
	
- ###### Returning to research group
- Verdant will apologise for underestimation the severity of the mission and for wrongly anticipation their behaviour.
- Also, DO NOT give the party the choice to reject Verdant as their missiongiver.
	- After completing the mission, the party returns to the research group and will most likely confront Verdant about the mission danger. He will give the party their reward and will tell Hunter that while he does need to oblige with the demands of the Shoka Engineering Collective, the letter was intercepted and edited by the Intelligence Agency to ensure the participation of the Simic.
	- He learned from his missions, and from the information that Salina provided, that everybody in this research group has some sort of connection with the temple in one way or another. Either they were born in the city near the temple or led to the temple one way or another.
		- Aki was lead by the fey
		- Ratronus was born underneath the temple and dealt with 'divine' influences
		- Hunter is in direct connection with the Concept of Exploration by means of the hunter group
		- Chron was sent to the temple by the prophecy
			- Verdant will offer his help in reaching the indiviual goals of the partymembers, hopefully ensuring their cooperation.
	- as such, Verdant offers to contract the party and give them a safer mission, in return for protection, housing, shop maintenance and pocket money -> allude to the fact that he, as an Eladrin and Fey, cannot lie.
		- Verdant will also offer to answer questions, either public or private.
			- Questions regarding Semyon will be met with Verdant stating no reasons to believe that Semyon may be manipulating him.
		- This mission will consist of exploring the city and, mainly, Rankhra to get more insight in why the temple was constructed and what could be a way into the temple. This mission will mainly be gathering information and reporting.
			- Verdant will give the party a Comet for fast messaging, just in case anything else like Rubae happens again, they can call in for help or pointers.
	- Leave some room for Cynthia's introduction.

###### To Rankhra
- The mission explanation will be worded in order to give the party a strong hint that they need to go to Rankhra. Also proved a map of the First Domain and Centroscopia for shopping and perhaps for some closed stores that I may expand upon later.
- Upon arriving at Rankhra, the party may snoop around the temple and find information about 2 specific locations; Janib'Rankhra, A temple located to the west of the city, where Aki initially entered the Mortal Plane; The Badawi Hunter Tribe, a nomadic tribe that continuously moves along the desert, driven by a strong sense of exploration.
	- Aki rolls a COnstitution save, telling her that there is some foxglove nearby and giving flavourtext that the rest of the party smells a pungent, sour smell.
	- The foxglove is, unfortunately, located within the temple boundaries itself. This will serve as an in-game guide that the temple cannot be accessed by normal means.


So go towards some sort of temple that may contain information about the fact that janib rankhra exists
	if that doesnt work this may need to be something elske
		and if they decide to directly investigate the Concepts, they may go to someplace else
		but this leads to more freedom and mayy lead to more seperation regarding the mission structure that may feel railroady.

Rankra will somehow give them pointers towards Janib'rankhra, which is a significant place for Aki.
	TODO: more lore about Janib'rankhra
This temple will have some sort of closed door which contains a puzzle. that can only be solved usnig knowledge about the Feywild

	cynthia's character will probaby play a role in leading them towards janib rankhra


Within the temple the concepts are explained in very high-levl terms and will also give them a rough list of the known concepts and their whereabouts.
	Hunter will need to roll a history check if he remembers wvweything about the hunter greoup that is lead by the concept of ecploration, of if he simply has a feeling that he is forgetting something.




anyway combat should then be some less personal thing like bandits or such or animals
