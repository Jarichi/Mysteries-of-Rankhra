 I might just write a singular character (or character duo) that will be relevant for every concept.
For this arc, Semyon will be important.

THe eventual goal of this arc might not even be to arrive at the city of change, but to get misdirected by Cynthia and arrive at the Phiaro Basin, where the concept of reflection is located. Maybe, and assuming marilyne is kind of gonna be the bossfight of this arc (if that sounds like a good idea), the party will end up in the basin first, before eventually leaving and getting to the city of change after all. If I decided that marilyne is not gonna be the final boss, Semyon will probably be some sort of crux character, but it's not like he is trusted right now.

Maybe I'll decide that Semyon is actually the good guy at the moment, and will just help.

I also am planning on introducing the party to the divinities (gods of life and death) in a more direct way for now, but they have not really fought and killed one of the significant NPCs. Anyway, the party might visit the Sanctum of Death as well.

This arc will most likely focus on Ratronus' backstory and assuming I go through with the marilyne is the bbeg of this arc thing, will definitely focus on her backstory as well.

Some major story points are the first meeting with Semyon, possibly receiving a fun investigation mission to relieve the party from some stress and teach them about some world lore that I still need to write, ultimately uncovering some details about semyons past that may let the party trust him more, eventually travelling to the city of change with Semyon and probably some sort of intense bossfight.

I guess the main todo list is as follows

## TODO
- develop senyon as a character
- develop the city of change and why nobody really goes to it
- develop the 3rd domain further
	- and by extension, the 2nd domain
- create fun side missions that include puzzles and creative thinking
- develop divine lore


# Session 1
- Semyon will be introduced. Note that he is not trusted.
- He will ask about what they have accomplished, since Semyons informants have given him word about the arrival of the gang and assumes they have completed their mission.
	- Gives reward
- He will compliment their work.
- Reason for showing up in person is because he believes that they have uncovered a very important fact about the forces that play a large role in the world.
- He will send Chrone away on some mission related to the Concept of Growth.
- Even though Semyon has a high-stakes mission, he still needs the party to prove themselves and evaluate their worth, so he has prepared a small mission for them.
	- [[A2SQ1 - Probably the newspaper chase]] - Investigate the newspaper agency. Semyon suspects them to be compromised by a third party. This will reveal lore about Hunter and what the Shoka Engineering Collective is up to.
	- [[A2SQ2 - Probably bandit investigation]] - Investigate the rising prescence of criminality in the city. This will reveal lore about Ratronus, Mycelio and what the Concept of Flow is undergoing.
	- [[A2SQ3 - Some other mission]] - Do stuff and be cool
- He also allows the party to simply take a day off and explore the city, but he expects them to return to him after this day. Maybe useful for preparation.
	- [[Zal'Aata - POIs]]
- After completing at least one of these missions for a reward, something will happen that serves as a canon event.
