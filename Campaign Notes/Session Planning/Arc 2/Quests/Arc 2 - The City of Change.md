 I might just write a singular character (or character duo) that will be relevant for every concept.
For this arc, Semyon will be important.

THe eventual goal of this arc might not even be to arrive at the city of change, but to get misdirected by Cynthia and arrive at the Phiaro Basin, where the concept of reflection is located. Maybe, and assuming marilyne is kind of gonna be the bossfight of this arc (if that sounds like a good idea), the party will end up in the basin first, before eventually leaving and getting to the city of change after all. If I decided that marilyne is not gonna be the final boss, Semyon will probably be some sort of crux character, but it's not like he is trusted right now.

Maybe I'll decide that Semyon is actually the good guy at the moment, and will just help.

I also am planning on introducing the party to the divinities (gods of life and death) in a more direct way for now, but they have not really fought and killed one of the significant NPCs. Anyway, the party might visit the Sanctum of Death as well.

This arc will most likely focus on Ratronus' backstory and assuming I go through with the marilyne is the bbeg of this arc thing, will definitely focus on her backstory as well.

Some major story points are the first meeting with Semyon, possibly receiving a fun investigation mission to relieve the party from some stress and teach them about some world lore that I still need to write, ultimately uncovering some details about semyons past that may let the party trust him more, eventually travelling to the city of change with Semyon and probably some sort of intense bossfight.

I guess the main todo list is as follows

## TODO
- develop senyon as a character
- develop the city of change and why nobody really goes to it
- develop the 3rd domain further
	- and by extension, the 2nd domain
- create fun side missions that include puzzles and creative thinking
- develop divine lore
