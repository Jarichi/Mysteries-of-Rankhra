 I might just write a singular character (or character duo) that will be relevant for every concept.
Fir this arc, Semyon will be important.

THe eventual goal of this arc might not even be to arrive at the city of change, but to get misdirected by Cynthia and arrive at the Phiaro Basin, where the concept of reflection is located. Maybe, and assuming marilyne is kind of gonna be the bossfight of this arc (if that sounds like a good idea), the party will end up in the basin first, before eventually leaving and getting to the city of change after all. If I decided that marilyne is not gonna be the final boss, Semyon will probably be some sort of crux character, but it's not like he is trusted right now.

Maybe I'll decide that Semyon is actually the good guy at the moment, and
