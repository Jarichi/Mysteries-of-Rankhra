they pursue the newspaper article that basically said in thieves' cant that somone is trying to become an overlord and to give them money in the [[Gloomspark District]]
The party accesses the district, and investigates a closed-off home. They find remnants of an article and find a random person that is responsible for spreading this article.
They kill this person and essentially skewer his head to the wall as a message to not spread bs
Now they are faced with a decision; Do they attempt to pursue the spreader or do they do something else??
prep this shi
