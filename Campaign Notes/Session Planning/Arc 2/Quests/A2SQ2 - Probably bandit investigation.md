they pursue the newspaper article that basically said in thieves' cant that somone is trying to become an overlord and to give them money in the [[../../../../World Notes/Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/Third Domain/Gloomspark District]]
The party accesses the district, and investigates a closed-off home. They find remnants of an article and find a random person that is responsible for spreading this article.
They kill this person and essentially skewer his head to the wall as a message to not spread bs
Now they are faced with a decision; Do they attempt to pursue the spreader or do they do something else??

Essentially, what do I want to let this tie into? It seems that Marcus' letter is very much on their mind, who accuses Semyon of manipulating Verdant for his own goals
- I can either choose to make this true or choose to make this false
- THough I think it's a lot cooler to make this a true fact, but not for the reaon they think
anyway
## Storyline


- apparently, individual simics are willing to put everything on the line to become an Overlord
	- Why?
		- Most likely has something to do with the concept of Flow, where the third domain (which is now where the concept is located, when entering the temple)
		- The concept of flow stimulates the flow of power, and therefore stimulates everchanging shifts of power that may influence the flow of information
	- One of them is Marcus, who was a human that planned to ascend to the power of Overlord, by revealing that the overlords are traced by the F.I.Z. - hence why Semyon would be the original mission giver.
		- Marcus has been killed by the party.

- One of these Simics is [[Dako]] - A female Simic who is in the process of ascending to the position of Overlord, but who must prove herself worthy of the position fulfilling the requirements: Being able to turn a trickle of info into a stream, being able to control this stream and essentially proving herself to be capable of controlling the flow of information.
	- When the party meets her, she will be in the process of fulfilling the last requirement of becoming an Overlord, unlock powers and most likely end up in combat.
	- I do want the party to have some form of compassion for her tho. :3
	- Dako used [[Vanan]] (who is not that important since hes dead) to spread this information
- After sending the message to Vanan in order to spread it to the city, Dako vanished to [[some other lcation]] to fulfill the rest of her quest
- The party will track her down, in accordance with Semyon
- This mission will not be completed in a few sessions, but will have a break to let the party kind of feel like there is a dead end here.
	- And to give me some time to work this rather large mission out. THis will be a stroy missison
