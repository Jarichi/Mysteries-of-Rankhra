# Summary
Party needs to do some digging onto the newspaper agency. They might discover the Ghost Journal, or at least some references to it. This leads them to find more interesting thigs about the shoka collective.

- upon heading outside of the sewers during the "day" since they skipped their long rest kinda LMAO, they will receive a newspaper containing an article about the rising temple in the desert, with reaoning to believe the research group is responsible for this, specifically Verdant.
	- This hopefully triggers some sort of wariness
- The article also mentions rumours of a possible connection between the new temple (that seems to be inaccessible and protected by a similar magical barrier as rankhra), and the hunter group
	- The newspaper knows this because Hunter's comet is different and was spying on them.
- this is a reaon for them to investigate
- 

## Beginning of the mission
- party is sent to head towards the newspaper agency.
	- The reason why they are sent here is to investigate why the newspaper is suddenly able to know about the discoveries that the party has made, and more specifically, how much they already know.
	- This is a resonably social mission and i don't think there is any combat here.
- when they enter, they will see the following
	- IF they roll a high perception check, they will observe one of the people on the typewrites as being vaguely familiar
		- THis is [[Telas Muses]] - who is on a spying mission and sent by Semyon.
			- If the party chats with her, she will note that she was sent here to keep an eye on the newspaper agency and see why and how they seem to know about classified information, and that that has not happened before.
		- Also note that her voice seems like it is continuously changing
	- Large building
	- Lots of pneumatic ducts where capsules with papers can be put into
	- A large, central, blue crystal with a nighly pattern on it
		- Obviously a comet
		- Rolling high will note that while this crystal looks a lot like this one, you can see that for some reason, Hunter's comet seems identical while the other comets seem different
	- a large amount of desks with people both typing furiously on typewrites and writing eagerly in papers, drawing images etc
	- there is a billboard with what seems to be the latest edition
### Investigation details
- party can specifically investigate 3 main things:
	- THe billboard  containing informantion
		- Lot's of connecitons between rankhra and other things - some lines seem to be a different colout
			- Rol investigation, the lines seem to denote where informationwas gathered from, there is no legend.
		- Central topic is Rankhra - almost like they are doing their own research, parallel to the research group
			- This mihgt manifest in missions where someone randomly shows up perhaps, and may be funny for the party if they wanna ditch the research group.
	- the people on typewriters
		- They are writing up mostly slop and adverts
		- some of them seem to write about articles that tjhey have not seen yet. 
			- DM note, keep this contiguous!!
	- the central desk
		- Furthers the mission
		- 
## Meeting with Sabrina
- In the direct centre of the room, around the crystal, an almost circular desk is located where an important looking girl is reading drafts and talking to people
	- [[Sabrina Criter]]
		- WIS:+4
		- Int:+2
		- STR:-1
		- CHA:+4
- Speaking to her will be like:
	- Speaking to a politician
	- Confident woman, always ready with a quip or comment
	- Not easily intimidated - DC 15
	- She doesn't know a whole lot but masks it with charisma and wisdom
- she knows about
	- the comets that are swapped - though she can only see that certain things are different, nothing more.
		- THe party might assume this to be a research group specific thing, hopefully
	- She knows a lot about the comets in general
	- I hope the party picks up on this detail
	- She knows about the fact that communication is distributed through this giant crystal, to the sky dome
		- General lore about this skydome
	- She knows about what was told in the news
	- she knows that they are from the research group, but this is alledgedly due to acclaim
- hmmm
- SHe DOESN't know 
	- how much information has been gathered
	- She also does not know precisely what sources submit their information to her, and she refers to her supervisor if the party asks about this.
	- details about het employer
	- difficult questions will probably go to her supervisor
	- 
- If the party is finished talking, before the party leaves, Sabrina asks them if perhaps her supervisor can help them with anything regarding the newspaper article.


## Meeting with Raphaella
- If they play their cards right, they are sent to 
	- [[../../../../Raphaella Sophronia Galani]] - actual leader of Temple News 
		- Wis+5
		- Int+5
		- Cha:-1
		- str:-0
- Speaking to her will be like
	- Speaking to the quiet kid
	- Keen look in her eyes but insecure demeanour
	- easily intimidated, but does know how to deal with this in a smart way
	- autism
- SHe essentially knows what Sabrina didn't
- Is familiar with Semyon and Verdant
	- Points out how everyone seems to have a strange Comet, except for Hunter
		- Correctly assumes that Hunter got his pendant given to him with involvement from the Engineering Collective
	- The reason why she is in an aluminium room (blocks magic)
- Determined in her pursuit of knowledge
	- Informs the party on the secret newspaper for only the elite
	- this contains more of the rankhra mystery knowledge, since it seems like one member of the elite is keenly interested in the secrets of Rankhra

## An unexpected allyship
- She points out how the engineering collective is behind the distribution and the construction of the comets.
- She will only point out and investigate the difference between the comets if the party allows her to see them
	- SHe will ask where they got the comet from, and hmm
	- Do remember that i there is a leak in the communcation somewhere, the leak is through Hunter since his comet is not one of Semyon.
- Will she point out that whomever made the comets, is able to see any and all communication between them and log it somewhere?
	- Implying that the engineering collective is actually responsible for a mass-spying op and that the mission they got from Semyon is essentially a f.i.z. investigation under guise of research
		- the main goal for semyon is to see if the newspaper agency is compromised and if it can be used to counterspy.
- Raphaella does want in for 'reasons'


## Possibly heading back to the Shoka Engineering Collective
- IF the party wants ot investigate the eengineering collective, they are "welcomed" by the karen again.
