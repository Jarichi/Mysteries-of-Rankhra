# Summary
Party needs to do some digging onto the newspaper agency. They might discover the Ghost Journal, or at least some references to it. This leads them to find more interesting thigs about the shoka collective.

- party is sent to head towards the newspaper agency for [reason]
	- The reason why they are sent here is to investigate why the newspaper is suddenly able to know about the discoveries that the party has made, and more specifically, how much they already know.
	- This is a resonably social mission and i don't think there is any combat here.
- when they enter, they will see the following
	- Large building
	- Lots of pneumatic ducts where capsules with papers can be put into
	- A large, central, blue crystal with a nighly pattern on it
		- Obviously a comet
		- Rolling high will note that while this crystal looks a lot like this one, you can see that for some reason, Hunter's comet seems identical while the other comets seem similar but way more different/
	- a large amount of desks with people both typing furiously on typewrites and writing eagerly in papers, drawing images etc
	- there is a billboard with what seems to be the latest edition
- In the direct centre of the room, around the crystal, an almost circular desk is located where an important looking girl is reading drafts and talking to people
	- [[Sabrina Criter]]
		- WIS:+4
		- Int:+2
		- STR:-1
		- CHA:+4
- Speaking to her will be like:
	- Speaking to a politician
	- Confident woman, always ready with a quip or comment
	- Not easily intimidated - DC 15
	- She doesn't know a whole lot but masks it with charisma and wisdom
- she knows about the comets that are swapped
	- She knows a lot about the comets in general
	- I hope the party picks up on this detail
- She knows about the fact that communication is distributed through this giant crystal, to the sky dome
	- General lore about this skydome
- SHe DOESN't know how much information has been gathered
- She als does not know precisely what sources submit their information to her.
- If the party is finished talking, they are either sent away (and before they leave, forced to stay because sabrina pressed a secret button or something, and the party may roll a perception if they saw this)
- If they play their cards
