	!!!!!

 I might just write a singular character (or character duo) that will be relevant for every concept.
For this arc, Semyon will be important.

THe eventual goal of this arc might not even be to arrive at the city of change, but to get misdirected by Cynthia and arrive at the Phiaro Basin, where the concept of reflection is located. Maybe, and assuming marilyne is kind of gonna be the bossfight of this arc (if that sounds like a good idea), the party will end up in the basin first, before eventually leaving and getting to the city of change after all. If I decided that marilyne is not gonna be the final boss, Semyon will probably be some sort of crux character, but it's not like he is trusted right now.

Maybe I'll decide that Semyon is actually the good guy at the moment, and will just help.

I also am planning on introducing the party to the divinities (gods of life and death) in a more direct way for now, but they have not really fought and killed one of the significant NPCs. Anyway, the party might visit the Sanctum of Death as well.

This arc will most likely focus on Ratronus' backstory and assuming I go through with the marilyne is the bbeg of this arc thing, will definitely focus on her backstory as well.

Some major story points are the first meeting with Semyon, possibly receiving a fun investigation mission to relieve the party from some stress and teach them about some world lore that I still need to write, ultimately uncovering some details about semyons past that may let the party trust him more, eventually travelling to the city of change with Semyon and probably some sort of intense bossfight.

I guess the main todo list is as follows

## TODO
- develop senyon as a character
- develop the city of change and why nobody really goes to it
- develop the 3rd domain further
	- and by extension, the 2nd domain
- create fun side missions that include puzzles and creative thinking
- develop divine lore


# Session 9
When they return to the research group, the party will notice the same customers as well as a gentleman in a flawless suit sitting at the bar, sipping eternalbright (everclear).
	- This is Semyon, who will introduce himself as one of the founders of Lettered Lamenting and will call himself Sam.
	- Semyon is a patient, observing man. He comes across as comforting and open, but knows very well to not give away more information than necessary. 

- Semyon will ask the party about their current progress on the research about the temple and possible connections. He will also ask them to spend more time on researching the temple specifically.
	- possible leads are old people in centroscopia specifically, criminal gangs in the 3rd domain, information of the perspective of other cities and people.
		- Investigating Centroscopia is a social mission
		- criminal gang is a sneak/combat mission
		- cities is an exploration mission
	- **Depending on their choice, I know what to focus on **
- Semyon knows surface-level lore about the concepts and suspects that rankhra might contain something related to this. He has investigated janib'rankhra (if the party returns to this temple with the compass, they will notice (after perception) that it mostly looks the same, but looks too clean). and found the mural. He connects the dots and realises that the temple might be related to the mural.
- he believes, based on other knowledge, that the magical barrier of the temple may only allow people in that are somehow accepted or tried by the concept.
	- If they tell him about the hunter tribe, this will be confirmed.
- he suggests that the temple can only be entered if someone in the party somehow meets a set of conditions, and is connected to whatever lies within.


- Semyon will be introduced. Note that he is not trusted.
- He will ask about what they have accomplished, since Semyons informants have given him word about the arrival of the gang and assumes they have completed their mission.
	- Gives reward (they have only gotten shiv's reward)
		- 
	- I might also use the explaining that "semyon got information from informants etc" to substitute as a small recap for what happenedlast campaign/
- He will compliment their work.
- Reason for showing up in person is because he believes that they have uncovered a very important fact about the forces that play a large role in the world.
- He will send Chrone away on some mission related to the Concept of Growth.
- Even though Semyon has a high-stakes mission, he still needs the party to prove themselves and evaluate their worth, so he has prepared a small mission for them.

# Session 10
- [[A2SQ1 - Investigating the newspaper distributor]] - Investigate the newspaper agency. Semyon suspects them to be compromised by a third party (engineering collective). This will reveal lore about Hunter and what the Shoka Engineering Collective is up to. (what *are* they up to?)
	- [[Quests/A2SQ2 - Probably bandit investigation]] - Investigate the rising presence of criminality in the city. This will reveal lore about Ratronus, Mycelio and what the Concept of Flow is undergoing. Perhaps the utilisation of the book of Life by the Shoka Engineering Collective contributes to the distortion of the Concept of Flow. Something cool would be to reinclude [[../../../World Notes/Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/Third Domain/Marcus]] again
	- a mission that delves into marylines character more might be cool considering she is pretty much the only one who did not get any lore yet
	- same kinda goes for aki tbh

- He also allows the party to simply take a day off and explore the city, but he expects them to return to him after this day. Maybe useful for preparation. Semyon will also provide a basic map of Zal'Aata with some interesting sights marked on them.
	- [[../../../World Notes/Locations and NPCs/Makhshar Desert/Zal'Aata/Zal'Aata - POIs]]
- After completing at least one of these missions for a reward, something will happen that serves as a canon event.
	- When they head to the lettered lamenting again and walk through the alley, they are kind of intercepted or something.
		- "you head towards Lettered Lamenting, and go through this alleyway............."
		- "please roll an arcana check"
	- Maybe "Rubae" will appear again, and like tell them tsomething that might goad the party into going to the City of Change and subsequently being tricked by Marilyne.
		- In reality, this is Marilyne who appears to them while she's away.
		- [[Fredrick]]  will be standing normally and mumbling something in a certaing singsongy melody.
			- This melody will represent the concepts in general, and when I make OST for my campaign, this melody will represent all of the concepts.
			- "The songs are changing, ideas distorting" in a repetitive rhythm.
			- This is spoken in [[Truecommon]], but only the party can understand it. Rubae cannot
				- This means that by extension, Marilyne cannot understand it. She has not been in the temple, nor has she read the [[The Book of Life (magic item)]] in Janib'Rankhra, and has not received a key from the temple.
	- that guy will just be standing there, whatever direction they go. 
		- IF they decide to kill him or shoot him on sight, he'll instantly die, but his corpse will start talking
	- After the (hopefully) offputting interaction with him, they will feel a presence
		- Rubae appears.
	- Some dialogue:
		- He has been like this ever since I tried to take his memories... Almost like I broke him, somehow. I cannot understand what he's mumbling about, oddly enough.
		- I understand he is part of your "research group", correct? 
		- Well, will you tell me what he is talking about?
			- IDK
		- Ok the I'll kill him and keep you here until you tell me.s
	- When Fredrick dies, the same divine presence intercepts and breaks Rubae's spell, such that the prty can continue to the reserch group
- This event will lead the party to explore towards the City of Change.
	- Perhaps some sort of Changeling is found unconscious or insane and rambling about some cryptic line that might reference the strange occurrences with the Concepts (maybe some lines like "The songs are changing", "The rhythms have gone weird" idk), Semyon will be there as well together with Verdant and will bring the Changeling in for questioning or something.
	- Semyon will then point towards the City of Change for the party to head towards.


Telas Muses got her tattoo on her neck in teh city of change to be able to change her voice at will, and she knows a bit about the city.


note that perhaps in a later moment, an dmaybe before the city of change is visited, the engineering collective will be investigated together with Elise as TElas.
