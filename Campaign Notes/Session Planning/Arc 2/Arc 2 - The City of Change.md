	!!!!!

 I might just write a singular character (or character duo) that will be relevant for every concept.
For this arc, Semyon will be important.

THe eventual goal of this arc might not even be to arrive at the city of change, but to get misdirected by Cynthia and arrive at the Phiaro Basin, where the concept of reflection is located. Maybe, and assuming marilyne is kind of gonna be the bossfight of this arc (if that sounds like a good idea), the party will end up in the basin first, before eventually leaving and getting to the city of change after all. If I decided that marilyne is not gonna be the final boss, Semyon will probably be some sort of crux character, but it's not like he is trusted right now.

Maybe I'll decide that Semyon is actually the good guy at the moment, and will just help.

I also am planning on introducing the party to the divinities (gods of life and death) in a more direct way for now, but they have not really fought and killed one of the significant NPCs. Anyway, the party might visit the Sanctum of Death as well.

This arc will most likely focus on Ratronus' backstory and assuming I go through with the marilyne is the bbeg of this arc thing, will definitely focus on her backstory as well.

Some major story points are the first meeting with Semyon, possibly receiving a fun investigation mission to relieve the party from some stress and teach them about some world lore that I still need to write, ultimately uncovering some details about semyons past that may let the party trust him more, eventually travelling to the city of change with Semyon and probably some sort of intense bossfight.

I guess the main todo list is as follows

## TODO
- develop senyon as a character
- develop the city of change and why nobody really goes to it
- develop the 3rd domain further
	- and by extension, the 2nd domain
- create fun side missions that include puzzles and creative thinking
- develop divine lore


# Session 9
When they return to the research group, the party will notice the same customers as well as a gentleman in a flawless suit sitting at the bar, sipping eternalbright (everclear).
	- This is Semyon, who will introduce himself as one of the founders of Lettered Lamenting and will call himself Sam.
	- Semyon is a patient, observing man. He comes across as comforting and open, but knows very well to not give away more information than necessary. 

- Semyon will ask the party about their current progress on the research about the temple and possible connections. He will also ask them to spend more time on researching the temple specifically.
	- possible leads are old people in centroscopia specifically, criminal gangs in the 3rd domain, information of the perspective of other cities and people.
		- Investigating Centroscopia is a social mission
		- criminal gang is a sneak/combat mission
		- cities is an exploration mission
	- **Depending on their choice, I know what to focus on **
- Semyon knows surface-level lore about the concepts and suspects that rankhra might contain something related to this. He has investigated janib'rankhra (if the party returns to this temple with the compass, they will notice (after perception) that it mostly looks the same, but looks too clean). and found the mural. He connects the dots and realises that the temple might be related to the mural.
- he believes, based on other knowledge, that the magical barrier of the temple may only allow people in that are somehow accepted or tried by the concept.
	- If they tell him about the hunter tribe, this will be confirmed.
- he suggests that the temple can only be entered if someone in the party somehow meets a set of conditions, and is connected to whatever lies within.


- Semyon will be introduced. Note that he is not trusted.
- He will ask about what they have accomplished, since Semyons informants have given him word about the arrival of the gang and assumes they have completed their mission.
	- Gives reward (they have only gotten shiv's reward)
		- 
	- I might also use the explaining that "semyon got information from informants etc" to substitute as a small recap for what happenedlast campaign/
- He will compliment their work.
- Reason for showing up in person is because he believes that they have uncovered a very important fact about the forces that play a large role in the world.
- He will send Chrone away on some mission related to the Concept of Growth.
- Even though Semyon has a high-stakes mission, he still needs the party to prove themselves and evaluate their worth, so he has prepared a small mission for them.

# Session 10
- [[A2MQ1 - Investigating the newspaper distributor]] - Investigate the newspaper agency. Semyon suspects them to be compromised by a third party (engineering collective). This will reveal lore about Hunter and what the Shoka Engineering Collective is up to. (what *are* they up to?)
	- [[A2MQ2 - Probably bandit investigation]] - Investigate the rising presence of criminality in the city. This will reveal lore about Ratronus, Mycelio and what the Concept of Flow is undergoing. Perhaps the utilisation of the book of Life by the Shoka Engineering Collective contributes to the distortion of the Concept of Flow. Something cool would be to reinclude Marcus again
	- a mission that delves into marylines character more might be cool considering she is pretty much the only one who did not get any lore yet
	- same kinda goes for aki tbh

- He also allows the party to simply take a day off and explore the city, but he expects them to return to him after this day. Maybe useful for preparation. Semyon will also provide a basic map of Zal'Aata with some interesting sights marked on them.
	- [[Zal'Aata - POIs]]
- After completing at least one of these missions for a reward, something will happen that serves as a canon event.

# Session 11
### The vision
key points
- you were lady od rivers red
- wento the the desert to end the curse (by dying)
- divine intervention form the concept of refelction
- the concept reflected the curse into two seperate entities
	- "rubae" is this curse, maryline is the body
	- the curse wants to forcibly end the concepts and erase them/absorb them
	- maryline does not want to do this because she want sto reconnect with her lover
		- the bone might react
- concept of reflections will split this in turn for redemption
- but she needs to protect the concepts against discovery
	- somthing is influencing the concept of flow which is in zal aata
- therefore she joined the research group


### The rubae scene
- tingies to avoid werird font

	- When they head to the lettered lamenting again and walk through the alley, they are kind of intercepted or something.
		- "you head towards Lettered Lamenting, and go through this alleyway............."
		- "please roll an arcana check"
	- Maybe "Rubae/Lady of River's Red" will appear again, and like tell them tsomething that might goad the party into going to the City of Change and subsequently being tricked by Marilyne.
		- In reality, this is Marilyne who appears to them while she's away.
		- Fredrick  will be standing normally and mumbling something in a certaing singsongy melody.
			- This melody will represent the concepts in general, and when I make OST for my campaign, this melody will represent all of the concepts.
			- "The songs are changing, ideas distorting" in a repetitive rhythm.
			- This is spoken in Truecommon, but only the party can understand it. Rubae cannot
				- This means that by extension, Marilyne cannot understand it. She has not been in the temple, nor has she read the Book of Life in Janib'Rankhra, and has not received a key from the temple.
	- that guy will just be standing there, whatever direction they go. 
		- IF they decide to kill him or shoot him on sight, he'll instantly die, but his corpse will start talking
	- After the (hopefully) offputting interaction with him, they will feel a presence
		- the Lady of River's Red appears, **Non-physical manifstetations**
	- Some dialogue:
		- He has been like this ever since I tried to take his memories... Almost like I broke him, somehow. I cannot understand what he's mumbling about, oddly enough.
		- I understand he is part of your "research group", correct? 
		- Well, will you tell me what he is talking about?
			- IDK
		- Ok the I'll kill him and keep you here until you tell me.
	- When Fredrick dies, the same divine presence intercepts and breaks Rubae's spell, such that the prty can continue to the reserch group

- when fredrick is killed by smoke of the Lady, she disappears into a dark clowd which races to the party and then they are kicked out!!
	- gaping maw, red eyes, perception DC 18
		- failed dc results inj only the deep red eyes being burnt i nto the conscousu
		- 




# Session 12



perhaps, the party will tell semyon and verdant about the rubae bs
or, I will not even give the party a chance to avoid thus and kind of railroad everything, in the sense of teh following:

- the party then goes to lettered lamenting after the rubae interaction (550gp )
- either verdant or semyon will look worried and say that they found Fredricks lifeless body in the centre of lamenting.
- they will ask the party what the fuck happened because they felt an evil presence and then his body was there
	- the party might spill the tea but if they are avoidant, verdant will have investigated the bosy of ferderic and perhaps note that this is the work of some concept-related ability
		- que loredump of the concepts and perhaps an explanationfor why they want to know more about the concept of flow.
	- perhaps, ask the party what their goal is for their character, this will be fulfilled by the research group as best as possible, IF the party fulfills this mission.
- then, Semyon will tell the party about Yataghatay, the City of Change.
	- Cue some lore about Semyon as well.
	- Semyon will not tell the party that he is a changeling directly
	- Semyon will only insinuat ethat he's worked with poeple from yatagatay before.

![[A2SQ3 - Shopping in the Bazaar]] happens first as a break

# Session 13

- party got a shopping thing going so I'll make the hunter tribe available again which is funny
- get a chance to speak to diviner and bleeder.
Would be funny if the party, if they succeed on a roll, get to learn about yataghatay and where it is located

I also wanna plan stuff for Ratronus' Comet shenanigans, and it does feel like they have more of a desire to investigate the syndicate under the city, HOWEVER ratronus has had plenty of character moments for now, so I'd like to focus on Hunter and Aki

HMM maybe it's funny if, because the engineering.colective knows about the research group doing silly stuff, and possibly being on their tail, they decide to send mercenaries to lettered lamenting, which makes semyon have to either flee the city and/or take the party with him, to leave Verdant solve this

Semyon has a safehouse


- The concept investigation mission will be issued and will have to do with visiting the library
- then after this, perhaps make the party investigate the information available for the Concepts, and let them discover that apparently someone is actively censoring information (the engineering collecgive)


- after the interaciton with semyon and co, we will probably go into some sort of investigationoverarching mission for the engineering collective.
- they are censoring information regarding the concepts, and specifically the concept of flow since this is used for a "reason" by the engineering collective.

- thsi prepares for future prospects
	- this will lead in a long sub/arc mission to investigate the shoka engineering collective
	- the endi of this investigation might lead to the conclusion that the engineering collective is attempting to get to the city of change
		- maybe the party finds some sort of instruciton or somerhting related that might indicate some sort of onoging operation to go to the city of change
		- maybe theyll show this to semyon and he will decide to go along with the party.
			- alsp, prepare a sheet for semyon
		- buuuttt maybe they wont show semyon and hell decide to go along with them anyway
	- hmm
- then after the investigation they will go to the city of change
- I mightttt shoulddd maybeeeee make some sort of funny inbetween mission that has bleeder and shov maybe
	- maybe some sort of interaction thingy thattt migghhttt be a sort of reunion
	- maybe some sort of feywild shenanigan thingy
	- maybe some sort of hunter thing
	- maybe even marilyne?/


- this needs to be worked out tho but it does seem like a nice start for the continued story,


- This event will lead the party to explore towards the City of Change.
	- Perhaps some sort of Changeling is found unconscious or insane and rambling about some cryptic line that might reference the strange occurrences with the Concepts (maybe some lines like "The songs are changing", "The rhythms have gone weird" idk), Semyon will be there as well together with Verdant and will bring the Changeling in for questioning or something.
	- Semyon will then point towards the City of Change for the party to head towards.


Telas Muses got her tattoo on her neck in teh city of change to be able to change her voice at will, and she knows a bit about the city.


note that perhaps in a later moment, an dmaybe before the city of change is visited, the engineering collective will be investigated together with Elise as TElas.
[[A2MQ3 - Investigating the Shoka Engineering COllective]]


Thoughts; maybe Ra'Sheema wants to make a 10th level spell using the magic stored inside the flow artifact
Also, there is an NPC who can feel the presence of the Weave/magical field like space-time
Would be funny
