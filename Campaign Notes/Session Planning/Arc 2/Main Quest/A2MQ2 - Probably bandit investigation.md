# Background
they pursue the newspaper article that basically said in thieves' cant that somone is trying to become an overlord and to give them money in the [[Gloomspark District]]
The party accesses the district, and investigates a closed-off home. They find remnants of an article and find a random person that is responsible for spreading this article, and dealt with them to send a message.
Now they are faced with a decision; Do they attempt to pursue the spreader or do they do something else??

Essentially, what do I want to let this tie into? It seems that Marcus' letter is very much on their mind, who accuses Semyon of manipulating Verdant for his own goals
- I can either choose to make this true or choose to make this false
- THough I think it's a lot cooler to make this a true fact, but not for the reaon they think

## Storyline

After receiving word form Semyon to head to the third domain to further their investigation into the City of Change, they are med with the mazel-like nature of the gloomspark district.
This district contains a set of confusing alleyways (ofhwich I will giv eno cues for where they need to go, and of which I will definitely make sure to check if anyone on the party has cartography skills), which lead to specific places in the district.
each of these rooms contains a key to unlock the final room. 
This final rom caintains the non-binary (this time really) half-Simic [[Dako]] who is in the process of ascending to the position of Overlord, but who must prove themselves worthy of the position fulfilling the requirements: Being able to turn a trickle of info into a stream, being able to control this stream and essentially proving herself to be capable of controlling the flow of information.
	- When the party meets them, they  will be in the process of fulfilling the last requirement of becoming an Overlord, unlock powers and most likely end up in combat.
	- Ideally, the party should not want to kill them because they have information or the likes, except that ratronus most likely wants to kill her as swiftly as possible

The room is effecively closed off and needs to be accessed in a stealthy way to avoid detection. The room has thick, aluminium walls which make magic tricks unsuitable and sctying also impossible.
Furthermore, the heavy-ass door is locked and cannot be opened from he outside when locked from the inside.
- This implies a different method of entry - which is only known by some simics in part, which the party must find.
The goal of the story, therefore is the following:
- *Find a way to access the closed room in a stealthy way, to gather information on Dako and report back.*

#### How to access the room
- Under a certain tile is a small pond of water. Standing in it does not do anything. To make it do something and become sort  of a trapdoor, someone must hit a target 30ft away, whose position can only be seen when standing directly on the tiling. When the target is hit, a trapdoor opens which leads to a submerged section of water. This must be traversed by a small creature first ( a fox, for example) who needs to press a specific button (pressing the wrong button does somethign funny and dangerous, or trips an alarm idk), make their way back and swim through the tunnel. On the other side of the tunnel, the room can be entered from the ceiling, where the party enters a cutscene.
#### The Cutscene
Dako is speaking wiht an unkown figure (possible Zendikar, maybe someone else, but definitely affiliated to the engineering collective). They briefly speak about the mission to become an Overlord, as desired by the concept of flow. Some activity is done by Dako, and the party might be able to intervene.
The speaker will also talk compliment Dako that they have read the collection of books regarding the concepts stored in the atelier (the party ca split to check this out tee hee, and the books wil contain lore about the Feywild, the concept of reflection and the concept of change)
Then, once this monologue has finished, the Speaker will proceed with a ritual, which the magical brandishing of Dako with an inverted eye symbol that signifies the fact that they are about to become an overlord
- this is the ritual that is performed to mark somebody as an overlord. Ratronus might find this interesting
The party is therefore faced with a choice; who will visit the library to gather information about the concepts and will anybody attempt to interveen with the ritual?
(performed by the speaker, Dako will protect him, so this is a tactical fight)

There might be a battle which is unwinnable and the art MUST flee the city in a chase scene initiated by Dako - who has now become a powerful warlock - Fathomless (aquatic warlock - but it's flow-based).

## Hazards
- Some kill corridors - Hunter can recognise somethign being wrong and Ratronus can spot for markings
- Unstable hallways - party must complete activities quickly or quietly to avoid simics from activating traps of desrtuction mechanisms
	- Perhaps Aki can recognise or listen for noises in the wals
- fey magic or powerfulentity prescent - marilyne and Aki recognises old magic pulses when in the chapel of death or in the gloomhearth
- 
## Activities and POIs.
- **Gloomspark Mantle** - the starting point of the maze, and the location of hte safehouse.
	- They can enter the maze from one main hallway leadin gfrom it. They are given a small map from the known paths which need to be taken wth.
- **Ocreatic Hearth** - Submerged village populated by some amount of simics - this is TEAM FOCUSED
	- A suspiciously young and knowledgeable human (who might have wanted to run for Overlord and knows about Ratronus) who lives in a submerged house all the way at the bottom (the party may be able to spot some simics heading to a house to provide information - perception if they so choose :3) is in possession of the location of the secret entry point
	- To access this knowledge and th ehouse, the village must be drained. THis is achieved by some actions which specific party members can do.
		- They must find a series of pressure plates to drain the village and open the doors, the person living at the bottom of the village does not brathe air like most simics, and is a simple human who knows thins
			- This forces the party to not use the simic water feature to cheese te puzzle; there is an airlock which needs clearing
		- All plates are in the village and must be activated by means of a certain skill o the party
		- 4 members means 3 plates and one simic
			- Hunter must sharpshoot a certain target somewhere hidden aboe thewaves (make a riddle)
			- Aki must doone of the funny hammer machines that requires a strength check and a hammer attach to reach above a certain score
			- Ratronus can already go down and swim for some exporation - he probably finds the riddle
				- [[Riddle]]
		- Every time a plate is hit, the water level drains and one of the airlock doors opens.
	- When the village is drained, the party has 5 minutes to get the intel from the guy and maybe ask other questions - [[Blake]] is here.
		- Blake tells them about the location of the hidden trapdoor when prompted correctly and by requestig information of equal value
- **Mantled Crucible** - this is HUNTER FOCUSED and TEAM FOCUSED
	- The simic who lives here is responsible for weapon trade in the 3rd domain and has made a number of secret inventions regarding weaponry. They also want to join the [[Festival of Tenacity]] (the shooting part) and only reveals the information for the secret activation point after someone who is capable with guns outskills him in a gun-focused 1v1 combat (the party can support Hunter in a number of creative ways) **Make a gunslinger character sheet**. 
	- the challenge consists of pre-duel segment which mostly just has some introducitons, weapon maintenance and explanation of te combat rules
		- This segment will have the gunsmith lightly sabotage Hunter's gun and lets reloading cost an action once instead of a bonus action, or makes Daan roll on the misfire table
			- If the party catches this, this won't happen and he notices.
		- The rules will be a forced 1v1 between Hunter and [[Brendon]], and if the party wins they get info and modificaiton and if the party loses theyget nothing
			- Of course, they still get the information due to recognityion of tenacity however they need to locate an underwater modification themselves or create a createive wyay of dealing with this.
	- then the duel begins
		- the party can sabotage Brendon by spellcasting or material sabotage, silvery barbs etc etc
		- hunter just needs to protect against incoming attacks first, then transition into actual combat.
			- combat is two-phased, on first phase is heavily dodge-focused for Brendon until a certian HP level, when he will directly attack Hunter while still dodging
	- When Hunter wins, they receive the information for the secret entryway 
		- The entryway is opened by means of a shotgun shell at the wall of a specific wall point - the gun needs an underwater mod which is given after the combat.
- **Chapel of Death** - this is MARI FOCUSED and TEAM FOCUSED
	- This location is a remnant of an old religious faction who worship [[Gentle Death]]
		- Party rolls history to see if they remeber thet one girl from the 1st arc to be a part of this faction
	- This remnant contains one book which contains the names of the deceased simics (Victor, Cupine, Elizabeth), some names appear to be highlighted
	- There is also a prayer table
		- Marilyne will need to meditate in this location and concentrate
	- when she concentrates here, undead skeletons are then created which attempt to break mari's concentration
		- some combat, about 4 skeletons
			- 2 swordsmen, 1 rangers, 1 skeleton wizard
		- [[Chapel of Death]]
		- [[Party vs Monsters]]
	- After her ritual finished, an image of Gentle Death will appear who will explain her mechanics, will briefly explain that there appears to be 2 precenses in the gloomhearth, one of which is very powerful and is successfully blocking her out of the room from scrying and one of which seem spotationally powerful yet needs to complete a ceremony first
		- if mari fails, the image will still appear but conversion is not possible.
	- the reward for beating the combat is 
- The maze itself
	- Contains the unmarked and shifting hallways, which lead to the various locations. They are patrolled by Simic bandits, creatures and other smalll challenges to make the travelling not boring. Maybe there are small puzzles as well idrk
- Gloomhearth - END
	- See cutscene


**IN ESSENCE, THIS SESSION/COUPLE OF SESSIONS WILL BE A CLASSIC DUNGEON ADVENTURE, BECAUSE THIS IS EASY STRUCTURE AND A LITTLE MORE ENTERTAINING FOR THEM THAN ANOTHE RLORE DUO**

### Broader story ties
- apparently, individual simics are willing to put everything on the line to become an Overlord
	- Why?
		- Most likely has something to do with the concept of Flow, where the third domain (which is now where the concept is located, when entering the temple)
		- The concept of flow stimulates the flow of power, and therefore stimulates everchanging shifts of power that may influence the flow of information
	- One of them is Marcus, who was a human that planned to ascend to the power of Overlord, by revealing that the overlords are traced by the F.I.Z. - hence why Semyon would be the original mission giver.
		- Marcus has been killed by the party by the way
		- note that the party believes that Semyon is manipulating Verdant for his own gain. What can I do to this to make kthe party believe something else? Or should I lean into this.

- One of these Simics is [[Dako]] - A female Simic who is in the process of ascending to the position of Overlord, but who must prove herself worthy of the position fulfilling the requirements: Being able to turn a trickle of info into a stream, being able to control this stream and essentially proving herself to be capable of controlling the flow of information.
	- When the party meets her, she will be in the process of fulfilling the last requirement of becoming an Overlord, unlock powers and most likely end up in combat.
	- Ideally, the party should not want to kill her because she has information or the likes.
	- Dako used [[Vanan]] (who is not that important since hes dead) to spread this information
- After sending the message to Vanan in order to spread it to the city, Dako vanished to [[some other lcation]] to fulfill the rest of her quest, as she has completed turning a trickle into a stream.
- The party will track her down, in accordance with Semyon, who will use the intelligence agency to trace her movements.

- This mission will not be completed in a few sessions, but will have a break to let the party kind of feel like there is a dead end here.
	- And to give me some time to work this rather large mission out. THis will be a stroy missison
