- this mission is mainly meant to passively show information about the world, to make it feel more alive and to NOT be a loredump and just be reasonably lighthearted.
- 
- When the party arrives in the Bazaar, they can go to markets ofc. The markets have peeps that have worls knowledge about certain things relevant to their roles, and have wares that are applicable to the party
- When the party nears shop completion, a sleight of hand may be rolled.
	- A group of young bandits are stealing from people, it is up to the party what they do with them
	- the bandits are not originally from Zal'Aata and have ended up here by a recent influx of tourists.
		- Where are they from? Probably centroscopia since there's probably a city there
		- maybe also oversees or down the river
		- it might be interesting if they are also from Yataghatay
	- I hope to make a funny session where people can spend money and explore the world more.
