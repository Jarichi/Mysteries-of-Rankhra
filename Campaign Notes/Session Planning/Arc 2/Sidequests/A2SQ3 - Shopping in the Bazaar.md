- this mission is mainly meant to passively show information about the world, to make it feel more alive and to NOT be a loredump and just be reasonably lighthearted.
- When the party arrives in the Bazaar, they can go to markets ofc. The markets have peeps that have worls knowledge about certain things relevant to their roles, and have wares that are applicable to the party
- The party will get a request from one of the merchants (probably the feywild merchants) go pull a prank on the alchemist students (and will also get this request from the students)
	- directly stolen from the site
	- But maybee the party will cook up some funny bs (which is in character for Aki)
- When the party nears shop completion, a sleight of hand may be rolled.
	- A group of young bandits are stealing from people, it is up to the party what they do with them
	- the bandits are not originally from Zal'Aata and have ended up here by a recent influx of tourists.
		- Where are they from? Probably Centroscopia since there's probably a city there
			- maybe also oversees or down the river
		- it might be interesting if they are also from Yataghatay
	- I hope to make a funny session where people can spend money and explore the world more.

## After the shopping spree
The party needs to get like some drops of information on the City of Change, and its possible ties to the concepts/concept of flow
perhaps, someone of the hunter tribe will tell them that they have heard of a mysterious city at a spot in the desert, hidden by sand dunes that seem to move on their own.
	this may be told by Diviner, who's true name is Demoven (/De'mo-ven/)

they also need to go to the badawi hunter tribe, who also have some inventory and might sell stuff as well. I do intend to move the campaign along and outside of the city, and end the arc soon. I might also want to rewrite the story a little, because there are wayyyyy too many breaks inbetween the sessionis which really kills motivation to write, frankly.

anyway

perhaps the hunter tribe shows up after the party dhenanigans are completed, offering the party a chance to re-meet Bleeder and Diviner, because they were the more interesting characters.
Perhaps Diviner has a more ready sense of recoginition because they have been blessed by the cocept of exploration
