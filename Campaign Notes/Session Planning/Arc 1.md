## Story Hooks
- meeting the party
	- Aki is in a store as an assistent, character introduction
		- Works at Daan's Garage shop.
		- they are already familiar with each other
		- They find a letter on their doorstep containing a notificatio that if they don't look for ways to enter the temple their sponsorship money gets retracted.
	- After escaping from his backstory significant event, he left the Third Domain and enters the First Domain, still in shock from what happened. He will haphazardly run into a store and will interact with Daan and Aki this way. I'll first spend some time describing the setting for him and start the introduction afterwards.
	- Ratronus was running from a 3rd domain goon group that was chasing him and meets Aki and Daan this way. Most likely will start from his perspective
	- Chrone is already a member of the research group and has already gathered some esteem, and is the reason why the party even gets the mission in the first place.
		- Chrone arrives in his wild shape (birb) coincidentally at the same time.
		- preceprtion roll for seeing the hole in the roof.


aki sees the letter, since she is the administrative worker and might lend a hand in the garage.
shes kinda the worker for all annoying tasks that ditract from the fun things

- Joining research group
	- Verdant introduces themselves and answers the most of their questions
	- They are allowed to speak with the NPCs in the area/
	- After introductions, Verdant asks them to join the research group, and immediately gives them a mission that lets the party go into the 3rd domain.
- Receiving Mission
	- Mission entails a search-and-rescue(?) of a number of former members of the research group, who left the research group without disclosing crucial information
		- This also immediately sets the stakes for deserting the group.
	- They are also lead to the sewers near the cafe, and are notably not told about the fact that money is useless in the 3rd domain, either by way of Verdant saying they needn't worry about that.
		- Note: they are not obliged to enter the sewers immediately, and are of course allowed to wander the city, or even go to the temple.



- Meeting person 1 - Salina
	- Upon arriving in the 3rd domain, they are allowed to read the message Verdant gave them, that contains instructions on getting towards that person's current location. If the letter is read multiple times, the location changes dynamically.
	- This section will be very roleplay and insight heavy and lets the party exeplore the Third Domain. They will need to go through several areas to get to Salina and gives them a chance to explore the world and for me to see how they play when they are given limited instructions and implications.
		- This will need to be properly thought out by means of some sort of map containing several points of interest.
		- I am expecting this to take time.

	- Layout of the third domain will be linked in a file.
	- Following directions of course leads them to a sort of ambush of a small criminal gang, who attacks the party and lets them have some combat fun.
	- Salina will join the party and is a level 5 cleric who can help with the combat.
- might split this by inserting a return mission.

- Meeting Person 2 - Marcus
	- Marcus is currently an Overlord and is also hostile against the party. This will be the main combat event.
	- Wether Marcus lives or dies, they need to bring him to the research group.
- Meeting Person 3 - Iridaiasba
	- This person gets killed by Rubae after which the party I suppose may use an action to do something i guess, and gets fucking k.o'd by Rubae.
- Returning to research group
- Receiving reward


## Planned Action

The players find themselves in the brimming nightlife of the city, wandering around all depending on their backstory and will run into each other by coincidence (15 min)
After common interaction roll perception. I might have blatantly stolen this start from Elise :3

all of the party is walking around the Bazaar and minding their own business based on their respective backstories. I will make them all roll an arcana check that will check if they notice a strange secondary pulsating magical energy coming from the temple (to plant the idea that they might need to investigate). On success they notice and are surprised by this. on failure they don't notice but they are allowed a lower save for the perception check.
After this, roll perception if they see people being taken aback. If they don't notice any people they will just go on their way and I'll need to figure out a way for them to meet in a quick fashion later. I don't expect everyone to fail both checks but if they somehow do I'll have to improvise.

Upon success, they will all walk towards each other and i will give them space and some flavour text that kind of tells them that this doesn't seem that normal. They don't immediately have to act but are of course allowed to stroll the bazaar some more. They'll eventually notice a folder hanged somewhere of a research group starting out that is willing to investigate the temple and is located somewhere in the outside are of Zal'Aata.

you wlk through an allyway but dont remeber what happened skull emoji fire fire fire


This will eventually prompt them to join a research expedition group that is, as many that came before them, investigating the temple and finding ways to either get inside or breach the magical barriers. If they don't join the research group, the research group will coerce them in a different way (for example, noting that they obviously don't belong here and threatening them).

the first investigation mission will take place in the underground area but everyone except Joris have no ideas for how to get there. upon arrival, the letter that they received from the guild reveals the specific information about the whereabouts of the mission and specific objective. The objective is to bring back one of the 4 former members of the research group alive. To get the whereabouts of the other 3 people, the party needs to either convince the 1st person to give up this information willingly, or force the information out of them (stealth mission)

after getting the information for the whereabouts of the other 3 people, go find the 2nd person that is quite close tot he 1st person (possibly combat cause combat is fun).
after findinf the 2nd person, this person will be really hostile from the start and will instigate combat yippieee

combat consists of the person and 3 minions, level 2 foes, not that difficult of a combatr session, 2 melee, cleric spellcaster, ranger
