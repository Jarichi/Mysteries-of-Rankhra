Dear Hunter,

You are receiving this letter as an opportunity. As you well know, your garage is being sponsored by the Shoka Engineering Collective  (S.E.C.). 
We recently received a request to provide a certain research group with individuals who have a variety of skills. Since you are indebted to the S.E.C., you have a good reason to fill this position. 

We received word that if you are not interested in this position, the S.E.C. will no longer have any interest in you and requires you to pay back your debt immediately.

We kindly refer you to the owner of the caf√© Lettered Lamenting for further instructions. The owner will, from this day forward, be your boss. 

P.S. Take the Simic currently in your shop with you. He will be one of your companions. If he resists, show him the symbol provided in this letter.

With Kind regards,

F.I.Z. (Federal Intelligence of Zal'Aata)

We kindly refer you to a billboard in the Bazaar with more informatio about this research group.
