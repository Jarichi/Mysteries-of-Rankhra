#story

This document will contain details and summaries of the planned action happening in the first arc.
## Session 1
- meeting the party
- Ratronus was running from a 3rd domain goon group that was chasing him and meets Aki and Daan this way. Most likely will start from his perspective
- Ratronus, escaping from his backstory significant event, he left the Third Domain and enters the First Domain, still in shock from what happened. He will haphazardly run into a store and will interact with Hunter and Aki this way. I'll first spend some time describing the setting for him and start the introduction afterwards.

- Aki is in a store as an assistent, character introduction
		- Works at Hunter's Garage shop.
		- they are already familiar with each other
		- THE PARTY DOES NOT KNONW AT THIS POINT AKI IS A KITSUNE
		- Aki sits on Hunter's shoulder and they head out
		
	- Hunter receives a letter via his Comet. Aki has the comet in her mouth and gives this to Hunter. The Comet materialises a [[Shoka to Hunter - Letter|letter]] from the Shoka Engineering Collective.
	- the Shoka letter writes about that the sponsorship money gets relinquished unless they figure out a way to investigate the temple for certain goals. It also writes about there being more information on the Billboard. Billboards contains a poster about some clothing store, a potion shop and a research group that provides protection and safe housing for new members who would like to research the temple.
	- This is the reason for Ratronus and Hunter to join the group.
- they head out and go towards the research group.
	- noteably walk through an alleyway, and I will pause. You go through an alleyway... ... ... And you arrive at a tavern.   
	- Chrone is already a member of the research group and has already gathered some esteem, and is the reason why the party even gets the mission in the first place.
		- Chrone arrives in his wild shape (spooder) coincidentally at the same time.
		- preceprtion roll for seeing the hole in the roof.

- Joining research group [[Lettered Lamenting]]
	- Verdant introduces themselves and answers the most of their questions
	- They are allowed to speak with the NPCs in the area/
	- After introductions, Verdant asks them to join the research group, and immediately gives them a mission that lets the party go into the 3rd domain.
- Receiving Mission
	- Mission entails a search-and-rescue(?) of a number of former members of the research group, who left the research group without disclosing crucial information
		- This also immediately sets the stakes for deserting the group.
	- They are also lead to the sewers near the cafe, and are notably not told about the fact that money is useless in the 3rd domain, either by way of Verdant saying they needn't worry about that.
		- Note: they are not obliged to enter the sewers immediately, and are of course allowed to wander the city, or even go to the temple.



- Meeting person 1 - Salina
	- Upon arriving in the 3rd domain, they are allowed to read the [[Mission Instructions no.1|message]]
	- Verdant gave them, that contains instructions on getting towards that person's current location. If the letter is read multiple times, the location changes dynamically.
	- This section will be very roleplay and insight heavy and lets the party exeplore the Third Domain. They will need to go through several areas to get to Salina and gives them a chance to explore the world and for me to see how they play when they are given limited instructions and implications.
		- This will need to be properly thought out by means of some sort of map containing several points of interest.
		- I am expecting this to take time.

	- Layout of the third domain will be linked in a file.
	- Following directions of course leads them to a sort of ambush of a small criminal gang, who attacks the party and lets them have some combat fun.
	- Salina will join the party and is a level 5 cleric who can help with the combat.
- might split this by inserting a return mission.

- Meeting Person 2 - Marcus
	- Marcus is currently an Overlord and is also hostile against the party. This will be the main combat event.
	- [[Marcus vs. Party]]
	- Wether Marcus lives or dies, they need to bring him to the research group.

--end session 1:
[[Arc 1 - notes]]

###### Session conclusions
Party:
- Verdant is not to be trusted
- Salina is not to be trusted but maybe
- Marcus must die (he died)
- Chrone may not entirely be trusted.
- Semyon got namedropped
- They may or may not trust anything with connections to the research group.
DM:
- Should keep stories consistent.
- Try to show off character's strength more (e.g. melee combat with Aki for her paladin abilities)
- make characters that can definitely be trusted
- may need to rewrite most of my planning and define plot points.
- ---
## Session 2
[[Gentle Death]], [[Marilyne]], [[Salina]]

SESSION RECAP

- after marcus' death, the letter by marcus will be incinerated due to Gentle Death death wish.
	- I sure hope they kept notes >:3
	- the filler combat NPC's death will be remembered by some house in the impromptu village DC 20+. Probably at the same house that that one Anna woman lived in.

- Meeting Person 3 - Frederic
	- The party will continue looking for Frederic and will probably just find some sort of trail towards him, OR EVEN BETTER, he will simply run into the party panicking because he needs to get back to Verdant.
		- Hopefully, the accounts of people trusting Verdant will lead to an increase in trust for the party. ANYWAY,
	- Fredrick will be sitting on the ground and looking dazed, mumbling unintelligibly, while a strong magical force and a shade is looming over him.
		- Upon seeing the party, Rubae - this shadow - will stop interrogating Frederic and get ready to kill him instantly.
			- If the party intervenes by neutralising magic or hitting rubae (AC 18, to DMs discretion), Rubae will instead gravely injure fredric and teleport away.
			- If the party does not intervene, Frederic dies and Rubae's teleport will fail.
			- "Hm, that creature actually used its Parting Gift to do this? How... disappointing." (with disbelief)
		- If the party ask Salina about Gentle Death or Parting Gifts, she will reveal some information about this since she's a member of the Sanctum of Death.
	- The party will most likely take Frederic with them. Frederic will simply mumble "The water must not stop" or something along these lines

[[Verdant Selemno]], [[Martin Isla]], [[Semyon Voltaire]], [[Reggi Buer]], [[Sasha Regis]], [[Telas Muses.pdf]]
###### Returning to research group
- All previously present NPCs are still there. Telas is still singing, Reggi is now at the bar chatting up Martin, and Sasha is just walking out of the kitchen, curerntly taking the shape of a female halfling with short, blonde hair.
- Verdant will apologise for underestimation the severity of the mission and for wrongly anticipation their behaviour.
- Also, DO NOT give the party the choice to reject Verdant as their mission-giver.
	- After completing the mission, the party returns to the research group and will most likely confront Verdant about the mission danger. He will give the party their reward and will tell Hunter that while he does need to oblige with the demands of the Shoka Engineering Collective, the letter was intercepted and edited by the Intelligence Agency to ensure the participation of the Simic.
	- He learned from his missions via Parting Gift, and confirmed by the information that Salina provided, that everybody in this research group has some sort of connection with the temple in one way or another. Either they were born in the city near the temple or led to the temple one way or another.
		- Aki was lead by the fey
		- Ratronus was born underneath the temple and dealt with 'divine' influences (foxglove causes highness and hallicunations, causing a trip and new voices flowing in your mind or smthn)
		- Hunter is in direct connection with the Concept of Exploration by means of the hunter group (some sort of mole that moves whenever the concept of exploration moves. Hunter initially doesnt know he is part of this group and initially gets a cold welcome, but one of the members suddenly sees this mole (one of us. one of us)
		- Chron was sent to the temple by the prophecy
			- Verdant will offer his help in reaching the indiviual goals of the partymembers, hopefully ensuring their cooperation.
	- as such, Verdant offers to contract the party and give them a safer mission, in return for protection, housing, shop maintenance and pocket money -> allude to the fact that he, as an Eladrin and Fey, cannot lie.
		- Verdant will also offer to answer questions, either public or private.
			- Questions regarding Semyon will be met with Verdant stating no reasons to believe that Semyon may be manipulating him.
		- This mission will consist of exploring the city and, mainly, Rankhra to get more insight in why the temple was constructed and what could be a way into the temple. This mission will mainly be gathering information and reporting. Verdant will send them to the First Domain again, but directs them to the postal office to activate the Comet.
			- Verdant will give the party a Comet for fast messaging, just in case anything else like Rubae happens again, they can call in for help or pointers. This Comet needs to be activated, however.
				- Chron already has a comet, and as such doesn't need to activate his.

[[Badawi Hunter Tribe]], [[Janib'Rankhra]], [[Rankhra]], [[Centroscopia]], 
###### The filler
Make a map of the entire map

POIs
- Postal office to activate the Comet that they have received from Verdant
	- They meet the owner of the postal office and this guy is a very introverted type of guy
		- Head of communications, but very introverted
	- His name is something either very extravagant or extremely default
- Some shops (potion shop, clothing shop)
	- Potion shop merchant is a perpetually drunk girl who can be seen drinking her own potions
	- clothing shop merchant is a fashionista type person
- MAgic School (closed and empty)
- Shoka Engineering Collective (no admission/not allowed to enter)

###### To Rankhra
- The mission explanation will be worded in order to give the party a strong hint that they need to go to Rankhra. Also proved a map of the First Domain and Centroscopia for shopping and perhaps for some closed stores that I may expand upon later.
- Upon arriving at Rankhra, the party may snoop around the temple and find information about 2 specific locations; Janib'Rankhra, A temple located to the west of the city, where Aki initially entered the Mortal Plane; The Badawi Hunter Tribe, a nomadic tribe that continuously moves along the desert, driven by a strong sense of exploration.
	- Aki rolls nature check, telling her that there is some foxglove nearby and giving flavourtext that the rest of the party smells a pungent, sour smell.
	- The foxglove is, unfortunately, located within the temple boundaries itself. This will serve as an in-game guide that the temple cannot be accessed by normal means.

- Janib'Rankhra can be found when speaking to a merchant NPC who heard that there are four weird pillars to the west of the city.
- To connect the dots for the Hunter Tribe and the Concept of Exploration, they see an image of the [[Bahath Animal Guide]] and Hunter will recognise this image after some history or investigation check. On failure, while he doesn't recall the name of this animal, he does know what it symbolises.
- The party may choose where to go first.

[[Puzzle no.1]], [[God of Creation]]
###### [[Janib'Rankhra]]
- Aki will recognise the environment. This is where she entered the material plane
- The goal is to solve a puzzle in order to excavate the temple.
	- The puzzle requires them to speak 4 words of a topic that only they are familiar with. Each spoken word will give them a key, which they will keep of course for future mission stuff tee hee.
	- After 4 words, the temple will rise up and they are allowed to enter it.
- In the centre of the temple, a booklet lies. All its pages have been ripped out, except the first and the last pages. These pages contain the lore of the God of Creation.
- Upon touching the book, the temple will start to sink again. The top of the temple has a hole in it, and the party will be given about 2-4 turns to escape.
	- If they don't escape, they are just a little fucked.
	- hmm they need a way to escape that is not just a hehe secret way out
- If they somehow have a reason to ask if they are being scryed upon, they are :3
- After completing this mission, they will receive a message from Verdant asking if they have made progress with the exploration mission.

--End session 2
[[Arc 1 - notes]]

###### session conclusions
- Chron likes to do his own thing, the party doesn't really trust each other fully yet
- Aki slightly seems to trust Verdant, Ratronus and Hunter at least trust Verdant enough to warn him about possible manipulation by Semyon.
- Salina most likely will not be a recurring character
- They don't know about Comet letter materialisation. They probably need a letter delivered to them for show don't tell.
- The party realises that killing people is not without consequence. They have not questioned how the village inhabitant knew her son died.
- Aki is honest and cheeky
- Ratronus checks manhole covers nearby, most likely looking for criminals and entryways
- The party will literally follow missions and complete them efficiently. THis means that they need encouragement in order to actually explore
	- This either indicates that I am not giving them enough interest in other things, or the party doesn't realise that they are allowed to deviate from missions.
- They enjoy combat more that loredumps, so ideally I need to mix combat with loredumps.
- Chron noticed that I indicated that time flows more slowly near the temple.

----

## Session 3
		
might experiment with letting some events happen in the background and rolling steaalthily for these, just as Elise does.
- 
	-  cynthia's character gets introduced asap
	- depending on what she envisions, she either gets introduced as being sent by Verdant to simply sccompany them on their missions, or is a sort of messenger from the God of Death.
- After the party picks up the book of life, something happens, revealing the mural. the mural has a text in pre-common. "Your goals, while far away, can be achieved. Present the keys and your dreams are yours."
- After reading the sentence, the symbols and gems  flicker once. When certain people het close, their corresponding gem lights up.
- Roll history and reveal that one of the symbols was seen on the temple walls.


- The party travels back to the city and receive a message from Verdant telling them to stop by the research group because he wants to add another trusted companion.
	- Twan recognises her as being a part of the research group, even before he joined. also gives the party an immediate reason to trust her.
		- the party may share their current progress with Verdant if they so choose, or not lmao
	- verdant might suggest the party to go explore the city and visit some shops to probe for more information.
	
	- when they enter the city, they are given a small preview sample of a newspaper distributing the following stories:
		- BREAKING: Temple allegedly appeared in Makhshar Desert. Here are the facts.
		- Criminal activity on the rise. Correlation with influx of merchants?
			- Side-quest for unraveling a gang of bandits pickpocketing and robbing new merchants?
			- article commissioned by an old potion shop owner who sells generic potions for some value.
		- Biologist [[Cedar Zendikar]]: "Although there are certainly some difficulties, the Auroch population is finally on the rise." (Wip)
			- Foreshadowing for the Badawi Hunter tribe. Introducing a new NPC

Free choice whether they visit Verdant to inform them on the current situation or explore more of the city. If they do so and report to Verdant with the information, they will receive part of the reward, let's say about 400 gp each.

- City POIs are
	- [[Great Acadamy of Arcane Arts|Magic school]] (inaccessible due to lessons) in centroscopia
		- Currently, Magic teacher of the school of enchantment present. Will coerce the party to leave.
	- [[Distribution Center|newspaper agency]] (2nd domain)
		- Populated by Raphaella Sophronia Galani
			- She is a very shy dragonborn responsible for all of the news and distributions, and lead writer of the journal.
	- [[Potion Merchant|Potion Store]] in first domain, selling an array of standard potions and such
		- questgiver for bandit mission (SIDEQUEST)
			- The owner, Benson is a slightly unhinged, bitter shopkeeper with a disdain for the change of population that has recently entered the city. He runs *'Benson's Brews'.* and is a Halfling.
			- He will note that since the increase of traders and merchants, visitors of the city have been robbed by an aggressive group of bandits when they leave the city. This group is making use of the nocturnal lifestyle of the city and the non-nocturnal lifestyle of visitors to commit crime.
			- Will ask if the party helps him and rewards the party for their efforts. [[A1 SQ1 - In 'Brewed' Daylight]] for further notes.
	- [[Relic Merchant|Artifact and relic store]] in second domain
		- questgiver for Hunter tribe (STORY QUEST)
		- ran by former Badawi tribe member, Shiv, full name Parshiv. He is a regular ahh human
			- Same guy as the one who was at the temple and who teld the party about Janib'Rankhra
			- Explores sites of interest and the general area around the desert and around Cornucopia streak together with his assistant, looking for ancient relics
			- Sells relics of varying degrees of importance. He sells a Badawi statue, a finely decorated mirror which shows a slightly warped reflection of oneself, and other concept-related artifacts.
			- Knows mostly about the background information of the Badawi statue (ehich gets recognised by the party btw)
			- Hunter rolls for insight, gets a VERY strong feeling that the party must go there.
	- Shoka Engineering Collective in Centroscopia (allowed in the waiting room but seeing NPCs who have been waiting for literal days). They will not be allowed entry into the building.


---
## Session 4
- party is finishing their things in the city
	- this most likely means I have to improv Benson's dialogue and like give them a reward and such
	- The motive for the bandits is that they have been sent by some other city to attempt to undermain Zal'Aata's wealth. The real reason is because Semyon (they/them cause changeling) is selling information about the Concepts that Verdant tells him about *to* this kingdom.
	- Benson simply believes in racism/xenophobia
- anyway
After the party has finished their stuff, it's probably about 2 AM so time for them to explore the desert.
If not, most likely some more city exploring.


**Travel**

- Desert bulletpoints
	- Cold
	- Dry
	- Sand
	- Silent
	- Vast
	- Oasis
		- Humid
		- Cool
		- Fresh
	- Auroch
		- Musky
		- Loud
		- Danger/urgency
- 
- storytelling segment. Mention the coldness of the desert and the eerie silence. As the party moves along the desert, they spot an oasis. Hunter rolls nature if he remembers the oasis as belo-nging to the auroch feeding and sleeping place. He also remembers that auroch generally hunt near the end of the night to capitalise on exhausted creatures, and everybody may roll perception. If siccess, Ill give them time to prepare against the coming pack of auroch which appear to be fleeing from something (DC20) or running towards oasis (DC15).
- After the storytelling segment, combat OR some other interaction.
When the party leaves the city and heads to a direction, they run into a pack of 9 wild desert Aurochs, split in groups of 3. Ensue combat. [[Party vs Monsters]]

If it looks like they will die, they get ex machina'd by the Hunter tribe that kill the remaining Aurochs and offers help. Allusion to the fact that Daan is a former member. They are offered a place to stay and recover, and arrive at the tribe.

If the party ends up not attacking the creatures and an animal handling commences, they may avoid combat altogether.

[[concept of exploration]], [[Bahath Animal Guide]]

---
some notes for minisession with Cynthis
- party may find a blood potion on MArilynns person
- when Marilynn goes feral, her strength and charisma switch and she can no longer cast spells.
- 
## Session 5
- The hunters who were approaching the party are a group of 3 hunters on tamed auroch beasts; Bleeder - A tanned human with red eyes and a menacing aura -, Wanderer - An owlin whose dark talons are dotted with white dots, akin to an inverted snow owl - and Weaver - a tiefling who looks nice on the surface but might be a little insane
- The party meets up with the hunters who ask them what they are doing here in the desert near one of the prime hunting spots for Auroch.
	- They were chasing a group of Auroch for selling them to the city, when they saw the party.
	- They were kind of waiting until they either got in trouble or actually acted and when they saw the auroch group run on, they knew enough.
	- The person who killed the Auroch gets commendations, and compliments on their huntsmanship.
- After a bit of bantering, the hunter tribesmen take the party to their camp and allow them limited access.
###### [[Badawi Hunter Tribe]]
- Upon arriving at the Hunter tribe, Hunter will feel a sense of recognition since he's been here before.
- They are initially not allowed to enter the nomad outpost beyond the external resting tent due to traditional concerns.
	- Some nomads will speak to them but some nomads will only speak if they have proven themselves worthy.
- However, they are offered to wander around the settlement, possibly gaining information and wares (at an increased prize) or prove themselves to be worthy to enter freely for a reduced price.
	- Unworthy visitors are allowed to visit the store at an increased price and speak to NPCs with ties to the city.
	- They are also invited to speak to the NPCs that are around to see what they can learn and buy before combat.
##### Present NPCs

- Balthazar: travelling merchant whose personality is akin to Reggi, being extravagant and elaborate in his tales. Speaks gloatingly about how he traversed the dangerous desert after being attacked by vicious beasts and surprised by a sandstorm and ended up here, and has been staying here for a few weeks already, gathering tales and wares.
		- His information gathering is limited by the hunters and the fact that he is not worthy, and as such is not actually allowed inside of the camp.
sells the following:
		- HEaling potion - costs 60gp
		- Potion of Inner Wilderness: When drinking as a druid, it activates your wild shape as if you activated it yourself. When drinking as a non-druid, it Increases your strenght ability score by 1d6 capped at 20 and reduces your intelligence by the same value capped at 4, for 4 turns/1 minute - costs 150 gp
		- Potion of Shielding: Consuming this potion casts the shield spell on you, making you immune to magic missile and increasing your AC by 5. This happens for 3 turns - costs 200gp

- Weaver
	- Intelligent Storyteller: He has visited Zal'Aata on numerous occasions and occasionally visits the Grand Library. He speaks very calmly and clearly in poetic terms.
	- For general visitors, he can tell a great deal about historic knowledge about Zal'Aata, other cities in makhshar desert and the Phiaro River if prompted. For unworthy people, he only tells stories about the desert and none about the history of the tribe.
	- He knows general history facts about the city if they ask for this, but knows no specifics about the temple exceot that the reason for its construction is secret knowledge (for unworthy people) and related to the Seven Concepts (for worthy people).
	- He recommends the party to speak to others if they pass their test.
- Diviner
	- They are an alternative person enjoying weird trinkets and superstitious objects. Speaks in a stereotypical divine person way (floaty, soft, long words). Vaguely based on Terese. They imply to know the future of the people that enter their tent.
	- For general visitors, they know about most common-knowledge myths and legends. Also knows the mythical origin of the Hunter Tribe but only taks about this after they have proven themselves.
	 - Upon meeting them, they will give all party members a small trinket that may or may not be magical. An arcana roll indicates there are slight traces of something magical but nothing clear enough to define.
		 - Aki: Dowsing rod
		 - Hunter: Badawi feather
		 - Chron: Bark of birch wood
		 - Ratronus: crooked gold coin
		 - Marilyne: small bone of indeterminate origin.
	- After receiving the magical trinket, Diviner will light up a small vial of incense which will completely fill the tent with smoke, after which she vanishes.

When the party has finished looking around and is ready for their test, they are asked to assemble at the center of the camp. They feel the tension rising as the moon slowly climbs to the apex of the sky (perceptive individuals notice that there is a singular constellation present; the archer's), while the cold wind is softly howling through the dry desert sands. While the party sees a small owlcat perched on top of the central tent, keenly observing the party.

- ensue combat [[Badawi Hunters vs Party]]
- When the party is worthy, they are also explained that their memories will vanish at the discretion of the Bahath, and that they would need to write down their information in order to retain this.

## Session 6

combat is intended to be some sort of a bossfight

After the combat, the party is free to explore the settlement and speak to NPCs of interest. Their goal will simply be collecting information about the hunter tribe as per their mission.

bleeder wil compliment the gang on their combat prowess but hoped everyone wouldve hit their attacks more, and declare the party worthy


- Bleeder will mention that Bahath - in order to keep the true purpose and location of the Badawi Hunter tribe safe - will alter the memories of the party members, so if they want to retain information they'd need to write it down.
	- The hunter tribe will mention that this is an illegal practice and if discovered, the messaging will be taken away and destroyed.
- party is allowed to walk among the camp clearing and speak to some NPCs as noted below
- They will mostly inform the party about the lore of the hunter tribe and this serves as a test for me to see what type of questions they will ask about broad perspectives.
	- However, they are given a few breadcrumbs for what they want to ask, by emans of perception checks on their tents.



	
- Below are contents of the dialogue
	-  3+ main NPCs can provide information
	-  Weaver knows information about the historic origins of the hunter tribe. He also has a place with the City Library -> Storyteller personality, extravagrant, embelleshing
	- Bleeder knows information about the current status of the tribe. He never leave the tribe at all and doesn't have any connections with the city. -> Shifty, secretive, mysterious
	- Diviner knows infomration about prodictions for the future of the tribe. They have some sort of connection with the news agency and feed them interesting tidbits. They also are familiar with Cedar-> positive, nihilistic, happy-go-lucky
	- Teller knows information about the mythical history of the tribe.
	- Wanderer knows about the locale of the desert and what exactly is hidden within its dunes.
- One unique store that sells rare items and general items, ran by Balthazar.
	- Speaks gloatingly about how he traversed the dangerous desert after being attacked by vicious beasts and surprised by a sandstorm and ended up here, and has been staying here for a few weeks already, gathering tales and wares.
- store contents:
	- Splint: increases armor AC by 2, can be applied. 5000 gp
	- Periapt of Wounded Closure: Stabilise on next turn if dead, 3000 gp
	- Uncommon whip: 1d6+2, finesse weapon with 10ft reach., 500gp
	- Badawi statue: Same statue as the explorer has, however this one seems more refined and peculiar
	- Potion of healing


## Session 7
---

[[A1 SQ2 - Hunting Trip!]]

side-mission for hunting an auroch to get the spline.
	objective: hunt a large auroch to get Aki the spline that increases her ac to 21, making her effectively invincible. (side note, I'm happy she has reasonably low hp considering the damage she can deal and the defensive resources she has.)
	**true objective:** teach the party, without outright telling them, that leaving the hunter tribe removes important memories of the party about the existence of the hunter tribe.
		happens due to Badawi's influence, to protect the wandering hunter tribe from being discovered. the sandstorm also helps with this.
		the DC for preventing total memory loss is 20.
			below 20, memories get wiped and requires an appropriate check if they attempt to remember things from inside the hunter tribe.
			above 20, only core memories get removed and less important stuff about the existence is retained.
		core memories about the tribe include crucial information about the true identity of the members, all possible information about the concepts, contents of the trial and shop, the effects of the owlcat as spiritual leader, including its name.
			More specifically, the party will remember the location of the hunter tribe and will recognise them from somewhere but cannot remember where from (remembering requires a DC20 save)


## Session 8 (hopefully final session)

- after the hunter mission is completed, Wanderer will ask about their little adventure and ask if anything strange had happened, and where they found the Auroch
	- She will tell them about the fact that the mountains are very close, and that she's actually from the mountains.
- She'll congratulate the party on completing the mission.
- She'll offer to tell the party about the fact that the hunter tribe moves its location to a new location after a certain amount of time, following Badawi.
	- Also mention that thye mustve notived that their memories were tampered with when they left, upon which she'll mention she doesn't know why this happens but that Diviner knows more about these weird phenomena.
- She'll also talk about a few interesting landmarks in the desert (including Zal'Aata)
- Then she'll answer questions about other stuff etc and tells the party that Weaver and Diviner and maybeeeee Teller all know different bits and pieces about the lore of the hunter tribe, but since she's not originally from the desert, she only knows what she's seen herself.
	- Not her, but a different NPC will mention that Badawi also seemed unusually interested in the party, and that they might wanna check this out as well.


### NPC talking events

#### Weaver

Weaver will be very wary of Marilyne since she drank her fucking blood.
	refuse to avoid questions when marilyne is nearby since weaver does not really like her
	
 Intelligent Storyteller: He has visited Zal'Aata on numerous occasions and occasionally visits the Grand Library. He speaks very calmly and clearly in poetic terms.

went to the city, actual name is Ian Libra. He's currently present someplace in the city, the Hunter tribe will tell the party that Teller went to the city to gather some specific information based on the direction of their spiritual leader.
- he's in te 


after speaking to the final NPC, Bleeder will tell them that their spiritual leader wishes to speak with the party.

- when the party nears the concept of exploration, everybody gets a sense of divine energy from the concept. It is immediately friendly with Hunter, intrigued by Marilyne, Chrone and Rat. It will look very puzzled at Aki, like she comes from a place that has yet to be explored.
- After observing the party, the owlcat will attempt to make contact with the party ]
- preface the ceonversation that unbeknownst to most badawi hunters, leaving the camp will let memories of his choosing fade to the background of your mind. I will tell them that if they want to remember what will be said here, they will have to roll a n appropriate check or save, unless they write down or otherwise link the memory to something in a creative way.

- talking points for the concept:
	- Seven Divine Concepts, 5 are currently related to the people in the party either known or unknown, which are the concepts of Flow, Growth, Reflection, Exploration and Whimsy.
	- The Concepts inherently align with their goals, but he will not tell them whose goals are aligned.
	- Mention that a prophecy exists indicating that the concept of Flow seems to be disrupting the flow of magic near it.
	- Mention that in order to access the concept of change, they need to have a guide from the city itself, and very important for not getting lost in the desert, they need no head towards the waystone and they MUST go left, otherwise they may face a dangerous path.
	- Mention that the unearthing of the temple has set fate in motion and indicates that it has begun.

badawi wil lsay this information out loud, except for the directions part, for which he will "determine at random" who gets this information, to explore the trust this party has for each other. 
	copy paste: To reach the City of Change, you must follow a particular path through the Shifting Sands. You must go past the Marking - it will be clear once you arrive - and follow the direction of the ever-changing wind. Once, and only once the City appears on the horizon, you must immediately go against the wind, lest you end up someplace you should not be yet.

- He will conclude the conversation by conjuring a small red-inlined gemstone compass with a badawi feather needle (still points towards north) with a description on it in a language nobody can read, yet knows the meaning of.
	- Description reads "May discovery guide you."
- mention that this compass is merely a token of appreciation and may prove useful in time.
the motivation for the concept telling this information, is because it is time to explore where this world will head towards after eons of remaining static...

- After the conversation, the concept will leave in a way that is fitting.
- after the cinversation with Bahath, the party will return to the city and either report to verdant, or something else happens. They might even go to erm that one guy, Shiv, to collect their reward after 

- the combat and information of the badawi will take the good part of the day, and it will be daytime when they get back to the city.
	- they will notice that, during the day, the shops they went to are closed and the market stalls seem to be more active
	- there are more foreign merchants and a different version of the newspaper that they had gotten earlier is handed out in regular paper form
		- The following articles are on the newspaper:
			- Grand opening of brewing factory "The Alchemist's crucible"! Buying potions has never been this easy
			- Shoka Engineering Collective announcing a secret endeavour in 2 weeks!
				- An image of Hunter's shop is included in this article
			- [tourist trap adverts]
			- A small advert for Simic awareness with an address theat makes no sense for normal people but says a specific location in thieves' cant (Gloomspark District) in the 3rd domain.
	- the city seems more lively, but reminds them of generic tourist city vibes.
	- the people currently walking around are fancy types and well-off people visiting from other kingdoms, among which is Revium :3


- the city guards seem to be alert, chron, ratronus and hunter can tell that they are more alert than usual and the party may draw the conclusion that there seems to be something going on with the bandit groups
	- the bandits are now going to be connected to a deeper network that is under investigation by the FIZ
- 
- Shiv's store is closed since he's just kinda sleeping, the shop has a sign that says to please message him on his comet for urgent matters, with an address pointing to the newspaper agency.
- telling Shiv about the information. I will roll for [a magic item on table F](https://dungeonmastertools.github.io/) as per agreement.
	- Cynthia will receive the ring of bravery
	The rest rolls
	


- newspaper agencyt is opened of course, and run by  Raphaella
	- She is a very shy dragonborn responsible for all of the news and distributions, and lead writer of the journal.
- Currently present people are a very stereotypical reporter girl named Kaya, who looks very busy and is writing loads of stuff when the party meets her
	- Introduces herself as lead reporter, is writing about strange phenomena in the desert and general hot topics (currently writing about an increase in crime, and writing about a breakthrpugh in the city history)
	- She will refer the party to her boss, Raphaella, who is sitting in her office, but only if the party tells her an interesting story
		- Kaya might be an antagonist trying to get info about the party.
		- Perhaps a 1st domain secret research group ran by the Shoka Engineering collective
	- The party needs to visit Raphaella to get information about how to use the comets for sending specific messages to other people, and she will mention that this is in principle an internal-use only comet that is intentiaonally limited to a list for approved recipiants, but she can change the programming if they so wish (100gp, depends on how much they tell kaya). (or pay a sum of money to send a message to any person (50gp), or buy a new comet entirely (not very expensive, 500gp unnegotiable)).
- 

- the wizarding school is opened for the public, there seems to be plans made for a graduation magic tournament (might be plot relevant later)
- The Shoka Engineering Collective is closed as of now, there are posters on the wall for job offers (a particular manager)

- hunter's garage is closed, so is the clothing store and the potion store.


- if they want to investigate the market stalls, they will notice that they are all filed with souvenirs, like small temple statues and that type of junk. it's also wayy overpriced.

- When they return to the research group, the party will notice the same customers as well as a gentleman in a flawless suit sitting at the bar, sipping eternalbright (everclear).
	- This is Semyon, who will introduce himself as one of the founders of Lettered Lamenting and will call himself Sam.
	- Semyon is a patient, observing man. He comes across as comforting and open, but knows very well to not give away more information than necessary. 

- Semyon will ask the party about their current progress on the research about the temple and possible connections. He will also ask them to spend more time on researching the temple specifically.
	- possible leads are old people in centroscopia specifically, criminal gangs in the 3rd domain, information of the perspective of other cities and people.
		- old people is a investogation mission
		- criminal gang is a sneak/combat mission
		- cities is an exploration mission
- Semyon knows surface-level lore about the concepts and suspects that rankhra might contain something related to this. He has investigated janib'rankhra (if the party returns to this temple with the compass, they will notice (after perception) that it mostly looks the same, but looks too clean). and found the mural. He connects the dots and realises that the temple might be related to the mural.
- he believes, based on other knowledge, that the magical barrier of the temple may only allow people in that are somehow accepted or tried by the concept.
	- If they tell him about the hunter tribe, this will be confirmed.
- he suggests that the temple can only be entered if someone in the party somehow meets a set of conditions, and is connected to whatever lies within.

# End arc

in the second arc, the campaign will be more mission focused and have clearer structure.
i will have PLENTY of time to come up with more lore and worldbuilding
