This document will contain details and summaries of the planned action happening in the first arc.
## Session 1
- meeting the party
- Ratronus was running from a 3rd domain goon group that was chasing him and meets Aki and Daan this way. Most likely will start from his perspective
- Ratronus, escaping from his backstory significant event, he left the Third Domain and enters the First Domain, still in shock from what happened. He will haphazardly run into a store and will interact with Hunter and Aki this way. I'll first spend some time describing the setting for him and start the introduction afterwards.

- Aki is in a store as an assistent, character introduction
		- Works at Hunter's Garage shop.
		- they are already familiar with each other
		- THE PARTY DOES NOT KNONW AT THIS POINT AKI IS A KITSUNE
		- Aki sits on Hunter's shoulder and they head out
		
	- Hunter receives a letter via his Comet. Aki has the comet in her mouth and gives this to Hunter. The Comet materialises a [[Shoka to Hunter - Letter|letter]] from the Shoka Engineering Collective.
	- the Shoka letter writes about that the sponsorship money gets relinquished unless they figure out a way to investigate the temple for certain goals. It also writes about there being more information on the Billboard. Billboards contains a poster about some clothing store, a potion shop and a research group that provides protection and safe housing for new members who would like to research the temple.
	- This is the reason for Ratronus and Hunter to join the group.
- they head out and go towards the research group.
	- noteably walk through an alleyway, and I will pause. You go through an alleyway... ... ... And you arrive at a tavern.   
	- Chrone is already a member of the research group and has already gathered some esteem, and is the reason why the party even gets the mission in the first place.
		- Chrone arrives in his wild shape (spooder) coincidentally at the same time.
		- preceprtion roll for seeing the hole in the roof.

- Joining research group [[Lettered Lamenting]]
	- Verdant introduces themselves and answers the most of their questions
	- They are allowed to speak with the NPCs in the area/
	- After introductions, Verdant asks them to join the research group, and immediately gives them a mission that lets the party go into the 3rd domain.
- Receiving Mission
	- Mission entails a search-and-rescue(?) of a number of former members of the research group, who left the research group without disclosing crucial information
		- This also immediately sets the stakes for deserting the group.
	- They are also lead to the sewers near the cafe, and are notably not told about the fact that money is useless in the 3rd domain, either by way of Verdant saying they needn't worry about that.
		- Note: they are not obliged to enter the sewers immediately, and are of course allowed to wander the city, or even go to the temple.



- Meeting person 1 - Salina
	- Upon arriving in the 3rd domain, they are allowed to read the [[Mission Instructions no.1|message]]
	- Verdant gave them, that contains instructions on getting towards that person's current location. If the letter is read multiple times, the location changes dynamically.
	- This section will be very roleplay and insight heavy and lets the party exeplore the Third Domain. They will need to go through several areas to get to Salina and gives them a chance to explore the world and for me to see how they play when they are given limited instructions and implications.
		- This will need to be properly thought out by means of some sort of map containing several points of interest.
		- I am expecting this to take time.

	- Layout of the third domain will be linked in a file.
	- Following directions of course leads them to a sort of ambush of a small criminal gang, who attacks the party and lets them have some combat fun.
	- Salina will join the party and is a level 5 cleric who can help with the combat.
- might split this by inserting a return mission.

- Meeting Person 2 - Marcus
	- Marcus is currently an Overlord and is also hostile against the party. This will be the main combat event.
	- [[Marcus vs. Party]]
	- Wether Marcus lives or dies, they need to bring him to the research group.

--end session 1:
[[Arc 1 - notes]]

###### Session conclusions
Party:
- Verdant is not to be trusted
- Salina is not to be trusted but maybe
- Marcus must die (he died)
- Chrone may not entirely be trusted.
- Semyon got namedropped
- They may or may not trust anything with connections to the research group.
DM:
- Should keep stories consistent.
- Try to show off character's strength more (e.g. melee combat with Aki for her paladin abilities)
- make characters that can definitely be trusted
- may need to rewrite most of my planning and define plot points.
- ---
## Session 2
[[Gentle Death]], [[Rubae OR m]], [[Salina]]

SESSION RECAP

- after marcus' death, the letter by marcus will be incinerated due to Gentle Death death wish.
	- I sure hope they kept notes >:3
	- the filler combat NPC's death will be remembered by some house in the impromptu village DC 20+. Probably at the same house that that one Anna woman lived in.

- Meeting Person 3 - Frederic
	- The party will continue looking for Frederic and will probably just find some sort of trail towards him, OR EVEN BETTER, he will simply run into the party panicking because he needs to get back to Verdant.
		- Hopefully, the accounts of people trusting Verdant will lead to an increase in trust for the party. ANYWAY,
	- Fredrick will be sitting on the ground and looking dazed, mumbling unintelligibly, while a strong magical force and a shade is looming over him.
		- Upon seeing the party, Rubae - this shadow - will stop interrogating Frederic and get ready to kill him instantly.
			- If the party intervenes by neutralising magic or hitting rubae (AC 18, to DMs discretion), Rubae will instead gravely injure fredric and teleport away.
			- If the party does not intervene, Frederic dies and Rubae's teleport will fail.
			- "Hm, that creature actually used its Parting Gift to do this? How... disappointing." (with disbelief)
		- If the party ask Salina about Gentle Death or Parting Gifts, she will reveal some information about this since she's a member of the Sanctum of Death.
	- The party will most likely take Frederic with them. Frederic will simply mumble "The water must not stop" or something along these lines

[[Verdant Selemno]], [[Martin Isla]], [[Semyon Voltaire]], [[Reggi Buer]], [[Sasha Regis]], [[Telas Muses.pdf]]
###### Returning to research group
- All previously present NPCs are still there. Telas is still singing, Reggi is now at the bar chatting up Martin, and Sasha is just walking out of the kitchen, curerntly taking the shape of a female halfling with short, blonde hair.
- Verdant will apologise for underestimation the severity of the mission and for wrongly anticipation their behaviour.
- Also, DO NOT give the party the choice to reject Verdant as their mission-giver.
	- After completing the mission, the party returns to the research group and will most likely confront Verdant about the mission danger. He will give the party their reward and will tell Hunter that while he does need to oblige with the demands of the Shoka Engineering Collective, the letter was intercepted and edited by the Intelligence Agency to ensure the participation of the Simic.
	- He learned from his missions via Parting Gift, and confirmed by the information that Salina provided, that everybody in this research group has some sort of connection with the temple in one way or another. Either they were born in the city near the temple or led to the temple one way or another.
		- Aki was lead by the fey
		- Ratronus was born underneath the temple and dealt with 'divine' influences (foxglove causes highness and hallicunations, causing a trip and new voices flowing in your mind or smthn)
		- Hunter is in direct connection with the Concept of Exploration by means of the hunter group (some sort of mole that moves whenever the concept of exploration moves. Hunter initially doesnt know he is part of this group and initially gets a cold welcome, but one of the members suddenly sees this mole (one of us. one of us)
		- Chron was sent to the temple by the prophecy
			- Verdant will offer his help in reaching the indiviual goals of the partymembers, hopefully ensuring their cooperation.
	- as such, Verdant offers to contract the party and give them a safer mission, in return for protection, housing, shop maintenance and pocket money -> allude to the fact that he, as an Eladrin and Fey, cannot lie.
		- Verdant will also offer to answer questions, either public or private.
			- Questions regarding Semyon will be met with Verdant stating no reasons to believe that Semyon may be manipulating him.
		- This mission will consist of exploring the city and, mainly, Rankhra to get more insight in why the temple was constructed and what could be a way into the temple. This mission will mainly be gathering information and reporting. Verdant will send them to the First Domain again, but directs them to the postal office to activate the Comet.
			- Verdant will give the party a Comet for fast messaging, just in case anything else like Rubae happens again, they can call in for help or pointers. This Comet needs to be activated, however.
				- Chron already has a comet, and as such doesn't need to activate his.

[[Badawi Hunter Tribe]], [[Janib'Rankhra]], [[Rankhra]], [[Centroscopia]], 
###### The filler
Make a map of the entire map

POIs
- Postal office to activate the Comet that they have received from Verdant
	- They meet the owner of the postal office and this guy is a very introverted type of guy
		- Head of communications, but very introverted
	- His name is something either very extravagant or extremely default
- Some shops (potion shop, clothing shop)
	- Potion shop merchant is a perpetually drunk girl who can be seen drinking her own potions
	- clothing shop merchant is a fashionista type person
- MAgic School (closed and empty)
- Shoka Engineering Collective (no admission/not allowed to enter)

###### To Rankhra
- The mission explanation will be worded in order to give the party a strong hint that they need to go to Rankhra. Also proved a map of the First Domain and Centroscopia for shopping and perhaps for some closed stores that I may expand upon later.
- Upon arriving at Rankhra, the party may snoop around the temple and find information about 2 specific locations; Janib'Rankhra, A temple located to the west of the city, where Aki initially entered the Mortal Plane; The Badawi Hunter Tribe, a nomadic tribe that continuously moves along the desert, driven by a strong sense of exploration.
	- Aki rolls nature check, telling her that there is some foxglove nearby and giving flavourtext that the rest of the party smells a pungent, sour smell.
	- The foxglove is, unfortunately, located within the temple boundaries itself. This will serve as an in-game guide that the temple cannot be accessed by normal means.

- Janib'Rankhra can be found when speaking to a merchant NPC who heard that there are four weird pillars to the west of the city.
- To connect the dots for the Hunter Tribe and the Concept of Exploration, they see an image of the [[Bahath Animal Guide]] and Hunter will recognise this image after some history or investigation check. On failure, while he doesn't recall the name of this animal, he does know what it symbolises.
- The party may choose where to go first.

[[Puzzle no.1]], [[God of Creation]]
###### [[Janib'Rankhra]]
- Aki will recognise the environment. This is where she entered the material plane
- The goal is to solve a puzzle in order to excavate the temple.
	- The puzzle requires them to speak 4 words of a topic that only they are familiar with. Each spoken word will give them a key, which they will keep of course for future mission stuff tee hee.
	- After 4 words, the temple will rise up and they are allowed to enter it.
- In the centre of the temple, a booklet lies. All its pages have been ripped out, except the first and the last pages. These pages contain the lore of the God of Creation.
- Upon touching the book, the temple will start to sink again. The top of the temple has a hole in it, and the party will be given about 2-4 turns to escape.
	- If they don't escape, they are just a little fucked.
	- hmm they need a way to escape that is not just a hehe secret way out
- If they somehow have a reason to ask if they are being scryed upon, they are :3
- After completing this mission, they will receive a message from Verdant asking if they have made progress with the exploration mission.

--End session 2
[[Arc 1 - notes]]

###### session conclusions
- Chron likes to do his own thing, the party doesn't really trust each other fully yet
- Aki slightly seems to trust Verdant, Ratronus and Hunter at least trust Verdant enough to warn him about possible manipulation by Semyon.
- Salina most likely will not be a recurring character
- They don't know about Comet letter materialisation. They probably need a letter delivered to them for show don't tell.
- The party realises that killing people is not without consequence. They have not questioned how the village inhabitant knew her son died.
- Aki is honest and cheeky
- Ratronus checks manhole covers nearby, most likely looking for criminals and entryways
- The party will literally follow missions and complete them efficiently. THis means that they need encouragement in order to actually explore
	- This either indicates that I am not giving them enough interest in other things, or the party doesn't realise that they are allowed to deviate from missions.
- They enjoy combat more that loredumps, so ideally I need to mix combat with loredumps.
- Chron noticed that I indicated that time flows more slowly near the temple.

## Session 3
		
might experiment with letting some events happen in the background and rolling steaalthily for these, just as Elise does.
- 
	-  cynthia's character gets introduced asap
	- depending on what she envisions, she either gets introduced as being sent by Verdant to simply sccompany them on their missions, or is a sort of messenger from the God of Death.
- After the party picks up the book of life, something happens, revealing the mural. the mural has a text in pre-common. "Your goals, while far away, can be achieved. Present the keys and your dreams are yours."
- After reading the sentence, the symbols and gems  flicker once. When certain people het close, their corresponding gem lights up.
- Roll history and reveal that one of the symbols was seen on the temple walls.

	- when this concludes, they return to the city and meet Cynthia, who will lead them to the city and travels with the party.
		- Cook with her in VC what she thinks is most appropriate 
	- In the city, they are given a small preview sample of a newspaper distributing the following stories:
		- BREAKING: Temple allegedly appeared in Makhshar Desert. Here are the facts.
		- Criminal activity on the rise. Correlation with influx of merchants?
			- Side-quest for unraveling a gang of bandits pickpocketing and robbing new merchants?
			- article commissioned by an old potion shop owner who sells generic potions for some value.
		- Biologist [[Cedar Zendikar]]: "After a period of lower births, the auroch population is rising at last." (Wip)
			- Foreshadowing for the Badawi Hunter tribe. Introducing a new NPC
		- 

Free choice whether they visit Verdant to inform them on the current situation or explore more of the city. If they do so and report to Verdant with the information, they will receive part of the reward, let's say about 400 gp each

- City POIs are
	- [[Great Acadamy of Arcane Arts|Magic school]] (inaccessible due to lessons) in centroscopia
		- Currently, Magic teacher of the school of enchantment present. Will coerce the party to leave.
	- [[Distribution Center|newspaper agency]] (2nd domain)
		- Populated by Raphaella Sophronia Galani
			- She is a very shy dragonborn responsible for all of the news and distributions, and lead writer of the journal.
	- [[Potion Merchant|Potion Store]] in first domain, selling an array of standard potions and such
		- questgiver for bandit mission (SIDEQUEST)
			- The owner, Benson is a slightly unhinged, bitter shopkeeper with a disdain for the change of population that has recently entered the city. He runs *'Benson's Brews'.* and is a Halfling.
			- He will note that since the increase of traders and merchants, visitors of the city have been robbed by an aggressive group of bandits when they leave the city. This group is making use of the nocturnal lifestyle of the city and the non-nocturnal lifestyle of visitors to commit crime.
			- Will ask if the party helps him and rewards the party for their efforts. [[A1 SQ1 - In 'Brewed' Daylight]] for further notes.
	- [[Relic Merchant|Artifact and relic store]] in second domain
		- questgiver for Hunter tribe (STORY QUEST)
		- ran by former Badawi tribe member, Shiv, full name Parshiv. He is a regular ahh human
			- Same guy as the one who was at the temple and who teld the party about Janib'Rankhra
			- Explores sites of interest and the general area around the desert and around Cornucopia streak together with his assistant, looking for ancient relics
			- Sells relics of varying degrees of importance. He sells a Badawi statue, a finely decorated mirror which shows a slightly warped reflection of oneself, and other concept-related artifacts.
			- Knows mostly about the background information of the Badawi statue (ehich gets recognised by the party btw)
			- Hunter rolls for insight, gets a VERY strong feeling that the party must go there.
	- Shoka Engineering Collective in Centroscopia (allowed in the waiting room but seeing NPCs who have been waiting for literal days). They will not be allowed entry into the building.


**Travel**
When the party leaves the city and heads to a direction, they run into a.pack of 5 wild desert Aurochs. Ensue combat. [[Party vs Monsters]]

If it looks like they will die, they get ex machina'd by the Hunter tribe that kill the remaining swines and offers help. Allusion to the fact that Daan is a former member. They are offered a place to stay and recover, and arrive at the tribe.

If the party ends up not attacking the creatures and an animal handling commences, they may avoid combat altogether

[[concept of exploration]], [[Bahath Animal Guide]]
###### [[Badawi Hunter Tribe]]
- Upon arriving at the Hunter tribe, Hunter will feel a sense of recognition since he's been here before.
- They are initially not allowed to enter the nomad outpost beyond the external resting tent
- After resting, they are offered to either leave immediately or prove themselves to be worthy to enter
- ensue combat [[Badawi Hunters vs Party]]
	
- Roleplaying-heavy
	- Talk to NPCs to garner information about the tribe itself and the concept of exploration
		- NPC names are not their true name, since names have power.
	- The eventual goal is to get infomration about the Concept of Exploration
		- Since there is no leadership, everyone knows bits and pieces.
			- 3+ main NPCs can provide information
				- Nomad 1 knows information about the origins of the hunter tribe. He also has a place with the City Library -> Storyteller personality, extravagrant, embelleshing
					- Name: Knower
				- Nomad 2 knows information about the current status of the tribe. They never leave the tribe at all and don't have any connections with the city. -> Shifty, secretive, mysterious
					- Name: Bleeder
				- Nomad 3 knows infomration about prodictions for the future of the tribe. They have some sort of connection with the news agency. They also are familiar with Cedar-> positive, nihilistic, happy-go-lucky
					- Name: Diviner
				- Nomad 4 knows information about myths and legends of the tribe
					- Name: Teller
				Other NPCs will refer the party to other nomads
		- The concept of exploration can talk to people but only if they are blessed by another concept or divinity or have speak with animals ready.
	- One unique store that sells rare items
		- Splint: increases armor AC by 2, can be applied. 5000 gp
		- Periapt of Wounded Closure: Stabilise on next turn if dead, 3000 gp
		- Uncommon whip: 1d4+1+1, finesse weapon with 10ft reach., 500gp


	- Either Chron, who has been blessed by the Concept of Growth, Hunter, who is a part of the trobe and as such gets recognised and may speak with the concept
	- The concept is a calm, intelligent being that is not quite concerned with worldly concerns. As such, it will answer any question it deems reasonable.
	- Its name is the Concept of Exploration, but it is better known as Bahath.
	- bahath will speak about how the concepts are connected to the entire area and are more influencial than they seem. Everytrhing is based around the concepts. Rankhra is also based around the concepts (chron knows about this btw), however the concept of flow is special enough that in order to access it, you must have visited other concepts or have been blessed by the God of Creation  or something.
		- the story might build up towards a sort of journey. The concept of exploration mught speak about how the concept of flow needs something done to it or somthingm, to cause some better motibation to actually enter the temple in the context of the entire story.
		- idk maybe the concept of flow seems to be mysteriously increasing in power and something must be done to balance it out, or the concept of flow is corrupting or changing in power and it needs to be destroyed, checked on, or sealed or whatever
			- I do feel like it might be time for some more long term goals to be entered into the campaign, and might end the arc after this setup. I also need to make sure this is worded in a way that I can terminate it earlier just in case the campaign will not last several years or something.
	- after the cinversation with Bahath, the party will return to Verdant and either report to him, or something else happens.
