- party will leave the camp upon which they will need to roll a wisdom saving throw DC 20 or lose memories with some flavour text
- hunting mission is gonna be some sort of puzzle, where they need to lure an auroch away from its gigantic group (they are currently lacking some resources, very intentionally)
	- combat would mean a VERY tough fight and while it is possible, it is not desirable.

- party will go to the oasis again where they will need to track some traces, ideally they will come up with this themselves.
- after the party investigates the oasis, they discover traces heading towards the Cornucopia Streak.
	- Chrone may roll a nature check to see where in the forest they are and where are possible places of interest
		- Large lake, where it is easier to ambush the auroch but the party needs to isolate it first from its herd before it can be pacified
			- Sneak based
		- Open plains, where it is harder to ambush the auroch but the auroch is alone so the party can easily attempt to pacify or kill the auroch without much of a fight.
			- Dex and strength based.

- after the auroch has been dealt with, the party can make their way back to the camp upon which they get their memories back, together with hopefully a conclusion that they need to write down or prove the existence of the hunter tribe in a way that allows them to take the knowledge with them.





- after completing the challenge, they may bring an auroch back to camp either dead or alive (but like most likely alive in a state of suspension or something or pacified or whatever)
- idk
