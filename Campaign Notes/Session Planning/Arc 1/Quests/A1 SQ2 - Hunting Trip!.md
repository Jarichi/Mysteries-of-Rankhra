- party will leave the camp fater which they will need to roll a wisdom saving throw DC 20 or loe memories with some flavor text
- hunting mission is gonna be some sort of puzzle, where they need to lure an auroch away from its gigantic group (they are currently lacking some resources, very intentionally)
	- combat would mean a VERY tough fight and while it is possible, it is not desirable.
- come up with a funny puzzle



- after completing the challenge, they may bring an auroch back to camp either dead or alive (but like most likely alive in a state of suspension or something or pacified or whatever)
- idk
-
