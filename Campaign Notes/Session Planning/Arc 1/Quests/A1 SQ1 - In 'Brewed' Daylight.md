## Backstory
Recently, more organised crime appeared to be developing in and around the city. Innocent visitors and unsuspecting merchants have reported to being ambushed by a violent group of bandits. Wares have been stolen and people have even been killed, yet due to the peaceful state of the city for the past century, the local guards were totally taken by surprise. As such, attempts to stop this group have resulted in failure and casualties.
Benson blames the crimes on the recent socioeconomic developments within the city, but is this the real reason...?

## Planning
- Benson's store got ambushed by a group of bandits. As far as the bandits know, they have been directed by someone else in the shadows to attack the party. This could either be Semyon, a powerful person, or an attempt of a different city to undermine the trading stance of Zal'Aata...
	- Maybe some sort of smuggling ring to an unknown place that got found out by Benson, or simply an aggravated attack for no reason.
- After combat encounter, Benson got rescued and will tell the party that he didn't mean to publish the news article to instigate hate (probably gets called out on it tho).
- Benson will offer the party 500gp if they solve the robberies.
- Benson informs the party that the best time is during the day, since the general public is asleep and merchants from other kingdoms arrive.
- If party hides themselves near the city gates, they will see lots of tourists and perception is rolled. If Rat succeeds, he will see some merchants with certain discrepancies that indicate they are not only here to sell warres but may be here for a different purpose.

- If Aki succeeds, she sees some Feywild Merchants disguised in their human disguises, who are intending to sell Feywild commonalities to the masses.
	- Wares would be Foxglove tea, which is advertised as a bitter tea that boosts "meetaphysical capabilities", but Aki knows this tea as being sweet and incresaing your perception and insight.
		- 15gp for fey but 35gp for commoners.
