## Backstory
Recently, more organised crime appeared to be developing in and around the city. Innocent visitors and unsuspecting merchants have reported to being ambushed by a violent group of bandits. Wares have been stolen and people have even been killed, yet due to the peaceful state of the city for the past century, the local guards were totally taken by surprise. As such, attempts to stop this group have resulted in failure and casualties.
Benson blames the crimes on the recent socioeconomic developments within the city, but is this the real reason...?

## Planning
- Benson's store got ambushed by a group of bandits. As far as the bandits know, they have been directed by someone else in the shadows to attack the party. This could either be Semyon, a powerful person, or an attempt of a different city to undermine the trading stance of Zal'Aata...
	- Maybe some sort of smuggling ring to an unknown place that got found out by Benson, or simply an aggravated attack for no reason.
- After combat encounter, Benson got rescued and will tell the party that he didn't mean to publish the news article to instigate hate (probably gets called out on it tho).
- Benson will offer the party 500gp if they solve the robberies.
- Benson informs the party that the best time is during the day, since the general public is asleep and merchants from other kingdoms arrive.

- during the day, the party may choose to engage combat or simply spy on the ambushers.
