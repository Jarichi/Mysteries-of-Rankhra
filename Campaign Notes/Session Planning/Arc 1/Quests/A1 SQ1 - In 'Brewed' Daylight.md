## Backstory
Recently, more organised crime appeared to be developing in and around the city. Innocent visitors and unsuspecting merchants have reported to being ambushed by a violent group of bandits. Wares have been stolen and people have even been killed, yet due to the peaceful state of the city for the past century, the local guards were totally taken by surprise. As such, attempts to stop this group have resulted in failure and casualties.
Benson blames the crimes on the recent socioeconomic developments within the city, but is this the real reason...?

## Planning
- After explaining what is going on, benson offers the party 500gp if they solve the bandit robberies.
- Benson points the party to a last-seen location and recommends them to go there during the day. where they will see some merchants get ambushed and attacked by a group of simple bandits. Ensue either combat or letting them flee and follow them to their hideout.
	- If combat, kill kill kill and when the bandit sees all of his friends die, he will plead and offer the party to the hideout.
	- if no combat, the party follows the bandits to their hideout.
