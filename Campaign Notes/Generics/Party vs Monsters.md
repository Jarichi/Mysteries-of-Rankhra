Scale accordingly

Note: Groups of monsters may be handled as a singular monster with the combined total HP, averaged AC and handled according to DMG(250). Note that similar creatures attack on the same initiative, which seems kinda strong so this will be divided into group initiative.



|        | HP  | AC  | STR     | CON    | DEX    | INT   | WIS    | CHA   | AVG dmg    |
| ------ | --- | --- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ------ | ----- | ---------- |
| Auroch | 45  | 14  | 20 (+5) | 16(+3) | 10(+0) | 2(-4) | 10(+0) | 6(-2) | 14 (2d8+5) |
| Cow    | 30  | 11  | 18(+4)  | 14(+2) | 10(+0) | 2(-4) | 10(+0) | 6(-2) | 9 (1d8+4)  |
- Charge: when moving more than 20ft and attacking with Gore in the same turn, add 2 attack dice to damage roll.
- Combat strategy, largest creature attacks alone with a charge attack, other creatures remain neutral unless provoked or kin dies.
- Beginning of combat: announce that one is charging at the party and allow one game action before rolling to hit.
