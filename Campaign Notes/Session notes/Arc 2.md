# Session 9
[wip]
# Session 10
- The party got a burner comet from Vadan
- Marilyne discovered that sunburn, and other disadvantages from the sun do not seem to affect her as strongly as they do outside of the city
	- By extension, only Verdant, Semyon and the party know about her vampirism.
- Accepted a mission - Investigate the newspaper agency
	- Reward: 550GP
- (They have given Salazar the letter from Balthazar) they are confronting Salazar on the adventures of Balthasar lmao
- They have taken on some disguises, provided to them by Semyon and Verdant.
- They have met up with Telas, who was also on a mission to infiltrate the newspaper distribution centre.
	- She has given the party the name "Sabrina", who is the receptionist and supervisor of the bottom floor of the newspaper distribution
	- She does not know who Sabrina's supervisors are, but suspects they have something to do with the Shoka Engineering Collective.
	- She also is unaware why the party was not informed of her mission, however it is safe to assume that this is because of knowledge separation.
- Aki visited Raphaella's study in the basement, which is in an aluminium room (aluminium blocks magic), and she appeared to study how comets work, how they are connected and magical artifacts in general. Her motivations are unknown.
- Aki also visited the conference room on the first floor, and discovered a folder of meeting minutes. The minutes are written in an unintelligible script, except for the names of the attendants:
	- Everon Lunares
	- Cedar Zendikar
	- Alys Nakayaru
	- Ra'Sheema Zal-Hiera.
- Sabrina was ambushed, and tightened to the desk by Maryline and Ratronus, after attempting to coerce her into relinquishing her supervision to Maryline. She attempted to do this by cleverly using Illusory Script to create a foolproof permission slip.
- Investigating the central, large comet - also known as an Asteroid - provided information that the communication net is divided into a number of separate networks, called constellations
	- City constellation - Routes all general-use Comets of Zal'Aata through this Asteroid.
	- Research group's constellation - Appears to manage the connection of the comets through a completely distinct  network. The location of its Asteroid is unknown
	- Some different constellation - Appears to be an independent network, specifically made for burner comets, known as Meteors.
- Ratronus has broadcasted the following message to the city constellation using the central Asteroid, in Thieves' Cant: "Abandon your post - everything is a lie"
