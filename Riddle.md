Beneath drowned roofs where streets lie still,  
A sunken town bends to the will  
Of time and tide and secrets deep  
That only trial and aim can keep.

First plate sleeps where watchers rang,  
High stone walls where echoes sang.  
Seek the eye that does not stare  
A hidden mark in broken glare.  
Loose your shot, precise and true,  
And stone will stir where none once knew.

The second waits where strength is weighed,  
Where iron sings and blows are paid.  
A hammer’s cry, a measured test,  
Prove your might to wake the rest.  
When force is shown and echoes roll,  
The plate will answer from below.

Two trials drowned, yet not undone:  
One by skill, and one by brawn.
