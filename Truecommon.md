As the manifestation of the [[Concept of Connection]], Truecommon is an as of now completely dead language, that has proved to be completely undecipherable
- [[Meeting Minutes]] are written in a particular variant of Truecommon, that has been modified to be read by exclusively the people that were in the same location and line of sight as when it was written
	Sort of like Illusory Script, but permanent and completely undetectable.

One of the perks is that it used to be the lingua franca of the entire universe upon its creation, but due to [[Significant Historical Event]], this has changed and the language could no longer be comprehended by all creatures.
