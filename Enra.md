Enra is a Simic hybrid - manta glide who was under guise of one of the overlords that Ratronus had killed. INstead of upsurping power, she decided to remain to care for the innocent children that are still abused to this day.
As a symbol of defiance, she wears short-sleeved clothing that exposes her maroon coloured eye marking for everyone to see.
