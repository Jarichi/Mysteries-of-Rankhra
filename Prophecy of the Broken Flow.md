When the threads of magic run awry,  
And the weavers of fate stand still,  
A force unknown, from shadows nigh,  
Disrupts the river, bending will.

In the heart of iron and stone,  
Where life’s pulse hums in crowded sprawl,  
The **Flow**, unbalanced and alone,  
Stirs from within its silent hall.

Five paths shall converge as one,  
Birch Elf of leaves and ancient bark,  
A guardian who’s lost their way,  
From lands afar, in lightless sway,  
A creature small, both keen and stark,  
An everyman of mortal birth,  
And fey who laughs amidst the mirth.

Together, they must brave the way,  
Through temple doors of shifting air,  
Where **Flow** now falters in decay,  
Influenced by the unseen snare.

But one key remains to be found,  
A mural waits for powers blessed—  
Gather the Concepts, all unbound,  
And let Creation be redressed.

Seek the **blessing**, one by one,  
Only when all have been bestowed,  
Shall the mural's light be spun,  
And the Flow of magic once more flow.
