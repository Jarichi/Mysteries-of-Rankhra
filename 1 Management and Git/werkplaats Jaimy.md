Cactus species
- this cactus is known for their changing colors and mostly grows on the outskirts of the city of change
- it has hallucinatory effects
- (maybe let the party drink an innocent drink and make them hallucinate something that isn't there or something that is there. (zoek maar op "Fonta genshin") voor de general vibe van het drankje)
	- misschien gemaakt door een side villain


- Collage of the siren bard: Telas Muses (Teles is een van de sirenen die voorkomen in de odyssey)
	- A compelling creature dedicated to singing in the café
	- Also a close friend of Verdant and a part of the research group
	- When not singing in the café, she is on missions to get information
	- has a special skill to "record" sounds and conversations. She can perfectly recreate these conversations
	- ([Bardic College: College of the Siren | GM Binder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-N5i-V0mIcZSQmZEbIHr))


Research Group might not be the sole provided of the missions



Story:
All party members are connected to concepts of creation. Janib'rankhra has a mural with gemstones and symbols representing the concept. The gems light up when someone in connecting with the concepts gets close.
The symbol lights up when a key is present (some artifact, or object,, memory, or whatever) Which embodies the concept.

Cynthia's character has been affected by the concept of reflection. She has a memory that she can't access, making the symbol flicker or smthn. She needs to visit the concept to get this back.



Twan: Growth
Joris: Flow
Robin: Whimsy
Daan: Exploration
Cynthia: reflection
???: change (semyon?)
???: connection 



HOOK: after the party visits janib rankhra, the bandits are now visiting the temple after they went there. The party discovers this if they go back with Cynthia to janib rankhra.
