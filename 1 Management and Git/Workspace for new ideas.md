## Feywild trader entry point

In makhshar desert is a place with natural magic, that serves as the original travel point for feywild beings to travel to and from the feywild
Maybe the crew gets a mission from a frywild trader to go to thiis place because they don't know what is going on with the floiw of magic
the crew then travels to an area that, when getting close the mystical push and pull of magic can be felt and the party may need to roll a save to prevent something from happening.
in this area, magic seems to be so thick and rich that it almost seems to manifest as a substance, forming either some form of liquid or some sort of dust or whatever, that mayt be harvested with an arcana and nature check depending on how you want to harvest it ((dc may be different based on what you do))
there might also be torii gates, to hammer the kitsune stuff more intensely

thhe first time the party goes here, they might  notice that while the magic is still as thick as ever, it feels more turbulent and chaotic in its flow, andmaybe there is a combat encounter against a group of magical monsters who can cast raw spells using the magic in the area. 

maybe the area is reminiscent of a zen garden surrounded by torii gates, with a rock formation in the center, and originally, tracvelling through the 8 torii gates in a certain order opens a gateway to the feywild, but when the party does this, the gateway seeems to open, but collapses and leaves behind some sort of residue

maybe the feywild traders havent checked wether this still works or not, due to culture (maybe they are only allowed to travel to the feywild on certain days or months, causing most feywild traders to save a stock in the material plane because they might stay for a long while)

## Semyon's deal
Semyon is currently waiting for the group to talk to him and we ended on a nice cliffhanger. How will I make sure that Semyon is maybe not entirely trusted but kind of like an avys figure?
ratronus and hunter don't trust semyon because marcus wrote an incriminating letter about him. this means that semyon needs to undermine marcus. perhaps semyon left the research group business to verdant and only took care of eberything behind the scenes (permits, location and information, security and all the things that are being taken care of when someone goes on a mission (perhaps semyon also made sure the guards know about the party and therefore did not stopp them even though there is a heightened security))
the end point of this conversation is to give the party another fun mission, maybe one in the city itself since I don't think I told them enough about the things inside of the city
(i do need to make a proper map of the city then, maybe hand-drawn if I want to and have the time.)

i'm also debating between letting the party go to change first, or to growth, since idk who got more basckstory stuff. I guess I do want to draw Twan more into the story so probably growth as a halfawy goal and the combat against marilyne as a primaty arc goal...

anyway, semyon

the way I want the party to feel abput him is trusting but not entirely. I want semyon to be teh morally grey person that has his own agenda but still gets help from the party. 

## tree city
since the concept of grwth causes trees to grow as well, what better whay to ivoprporet this into the story is by letting a big city be in a tree somewhere as a gigantic treehouse. might serve as an inbetweee point between the circle of the moon and the starting tracel to the concept of growtj

hmm maybe this is later than the cocnept of reflection anyway...


## The guards!!
I do need to think of something that describes the police force hierarchy in zal aata because there is about to be a criminal explosion which has been started by the overlords in ratronus' backstory and is fueled by bandits from other places entering the city. this might elad to the city becoming a more closed-off and private city due to restrictions on forign visitors entering the city
this guard task force needs to have a hierarchy and relevant NPCs.
