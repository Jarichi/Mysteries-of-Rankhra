#group 
The Envoys of Creation are a supernatural group which are tasked with protecting the [[Concepts of Creation]] in some way or another, and bear responsibility over whether they need to be revealed. Most, if not all concepts have an Envoy, and the alignment or motivations are not necessarily in line with morally good or evil worldviews.

### Known Envoys
[[Rubae]] - Envoy of the Concept of Reflection, to hide all knowledge from the public
[[Lysandre]] - Envoy of the Concept of Connection, to unite all creatures by vampirism
[[Ra'Sheema Zal-Hiera]] - Envoy of the Concept of Flow, to remove the meddling of the Shoka Engineering Collective. Only recently appointed.
[[Semyon Voltaire]] - Envoy of the Concept of Change.
[[Badawi Hunter Tribe]] - All members are Envoys of the Concept of Exploration, to create a map of the world.
