Puzzle consists of speaking 4 words to unburrow the temple

Four Pillars are located around the outside of this small temple. On each of the four pillars, a small symbol is engraved, together with a small text in the language as specified below, asking "Call my name."

The first pillar has a crude sketch of a Foxglove plant, and the text in Sylvan. 
The second pillar has an image of a large tree with a small elf next to it, with the text in Druidic. (Birch Elf, unless there is a better answer)
The third pillar has a symbol with a vaguely mushroom-shaped apeparance, with the text in thieve's cant. (Mycelio)
The fourth pillar has an image of an owlcat, with the text in Common, reading "Call my True Name".
	Hunter needs to say the true name of the owlcat, being Bahat.

The party needs to conclude that they need to say the names in the languages that the text was written in.
