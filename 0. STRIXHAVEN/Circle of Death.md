While the Circle of Death originally was one of the ancient druid circles that existed in a past long forgotten, it currently manifests as a collection of events that happen to individuals that are chosen by the original (number associated with death) members' spirits.

Long ago, when the circle was founded, it consisted of X members, each devoting their life to death and both the horrors and hopes that death brings. They saw the beauty in the cycle of life, and the end of it. They had a particular interest in necromancy; this magic could return death to life, or take life and transform it into death - while still being part of the cycle of life.

The original founders decided to perform a necromantic ritual, to eternally become part of the grand circle, that is life. They crafted a powerful pact with (probably) Arouse that retained their essence at the cost of their material bodies, and required them to sacrifice their life to seal it. 
After this was done, their circle became known as a tragedy in the Druidic sphere, as a failure and mass-suicide, and the essences of the original members remained to exist within the world.

New members are chosen by the essences based on qualities like ancestry to original members, visin and personality, etc

When a member is chosen they begin to experience a series of events, that are determined based on what Founder chose them?
Perhaps it's cool as well to let the events be ranging from generic, simple or funny things and ranging from suspiciously specific to very general.
THis is probably best discussed with Elise.

## Impact with A'luna's village
Perhaps the creaton of the Circle happened just before her survival
A'luna didnt want to take part in this and decided to not take part in this event, causing her to survuve as the only person in the village
Since she did get some knowledge about this, oerhaos this is the reason why she is so familiar wiht the soul types?
Maybe, since she was the oracle, she got this information for the ritual to create this circle but she dod not know the end result
	do look how and if this even fits within the alunas character?
	maybe?
this may tue into the soul type theory?
perhpas, this ritual provides the inlet for the soul type theory?
but in any case
- Aluna received intfomration from Arous for a ritual to creat ethe circle of death?
- Unbeknownst (or maybe beknownst but not on purpose) to her, she doomed her entire village and sacrificed them, excelt for her
- this action created the Circle of Death, which is an eternal cycle of reincarnation of the people who have perished in this way
- perhaps, the spirits of these persons have been reincarnated into other people, and this has lead to for example recurring trauma or events that indicate this reincarnation
	- For example, if my original villager passed away due to drowning under water by geting stuck, I have a fear of water and something close to me got stuck inderwater
	- In other words, my reincarnation has a direct impact on my fate
- Perhaps, these signs appearing around me and for me are a direct cause from this ancestor being involved with the circle of death
- My character has joined the school based on a personal recommendation of the teacher, who has suspicions of what ia the deal with this, since it is related to a massive national mystery
	- This may lead to a greater sense of communnity and s a step for progression
	- this manifests as a tattoo apprearing, or some event happening
