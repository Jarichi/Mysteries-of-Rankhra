Lysandre is one of the [[Envoys of Creation]], specifically for the [[Concept of Connection]]. Using his abilities as a powerful Vampiric bard, he employs the [[Art of Words]] to influence people around him, which may be close to discovering information about the Concept.

He is responsible for turning Charlie into a vampire - though he has employed the Art to only transfer some vampiric negative effects to him, to force him to be exiled from his village and abandon his train of thought, and to open up a pathway for him to take control of Charlie if need be.
