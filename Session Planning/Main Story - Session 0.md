## Planned Action

The players find themselves in the brimming nightlife of the city, wandering around all depending on their backstory and will run into each other by coincidence (15 min)
After common interaction roll perception. I might have blatantly stolen this start from Elise :3

all of the party is walking around the Bazaar and minding their own business based on their respective backstories. I will make them all roll an arcana check that will check if they notice a strange secondary pulsating magical energy coming from the temple (to plant the idea that they might need to investigate). On success they notice and are surprised by this. on failure they don't notice but they are allowed a lower save for the perception check.
After this, roll perception if they see people being taken aback. If they don't notice any people they will just go on their way and I'll need to figure out a way for them to meet in a quick fashion later. I don't expect everyone to fail both checks but if they somehow do I'll have to improvise.

Upon success, they will all walk towards each other and i will give them space and some flavour text that kind of tells them that this doesn't seem that normal. They don't immediately have to act but are of course allowed to stroll the bazaar some more. They'll eventually notice a folder hanged somewhere of a research group starting out that is willing to investigate the temple and is located somewhere in the outside are of Zal'Aata.
This will eventually prompt them to join a research expedition group that is, as many that came before them, investigating the temple and finding ways to either get inside or breach the magical barriers. If they don't join the research group, the research group will coerce them in a different way (for example, noting that they obviously don't belong here and threatening them).

the first investigation mission will take place in the underground area but everyone except Joris have no ideas for how to get there. upon arrival, the letter that they received from the guild reveals the specific information about the whereabouts of the mission and specific objective. The objective is to bring back one of the 4 former members of the research group alive. To get the whereabouts of the other 3 people, the party needs to either convince the 1st person to give up this information willingly, or force the information out of them (stealth mission)

after getting the information for the whereabouts of the other 3 people, go find the 2nd person that is quite close tot he 1st person (possibly combat cause combat is fun).
after findinf the 2nd person, this person will be really hostile from the start and will instigate combat yippieee

combat consists of the person and 3 minions, level 2 foes, not that difficult of a combatr session, 2 melee, cleric spellcaster, ranger
