Someone sabotaging the temple research group (planting the seed of evil) [[Rubae]]
Good character that is trustworthy but has a sort of hidden agenda

Think about symbols and imagery, and a main theme for divinity

Add stuff that I like as well 

In the beginning, Rubae will be some sort of character that may or may not be discovered by the party. If discovered and actially attacked, hw ill completely wipe the party while monologuing and yapping about how the party is not strong enough to stop him at this point, and utterly defeat the party. THis will be impossible combat.

After this, he'll heal the party and teleport away. I'm current;ly plannign on letting him appear at the end of mission one, to prompt the party to tell this to Verdant. Verdant will always know this information. THis occurrance will prompt Verdant to send them out of the city and to Janib'Rankhra for more investigation. THis may or may not fall within arc 1.

So current plan of events is (in large lines.)
- Join research group
- Start mission 1: find 3 people.
- When finding the third person, this person will get vaporised by Rubae after telling the information, and also I'll let the party roll some sort of perceptive check that lets them know something may be wrong.
- The party fights Rubae and will get clobbered.
- Party reports back to Verdant and shares infirmation.
- Verdant will send the party to Janib'Rankhra (nobody knows exactly where this is excelt for Aki)
