# Mechanics
- Hiding behind cover is a thing
- Party needs to have something difficult and interesting to do
- Semyon will get some trust, and perhaps reveal things about himself, like being a changeling
- the party will not return to Lettered Lamenting for a while
- the Engineering Collective will now act as an evil prescence in teh ciruhgjekgbfnea

# Environment
This is a bar, so there is a hiding space behind the counter, that provides TOTAL COVER
the bar is small and short-range, so close-range combat spells are more effective here
there is flammable amterial behind the abr as well, so cover may be removed at any point during combat

# Enemies
## That one bitch manager
- Enemy that Hunter has an advantage on and probably has pleasure to kill

## Random Goon 1
- Dangerous Scafry enemy that Aki might wanna deal with

## Random Goon 2
- Long-ranged spellcaster ideal for the rogue to hunt
- perhaps has a motivation for him as well.

## Random Goon 3
- Support character to avoid Marilyne from easily killing everyone, perhaps with trickery
- The support needs to also be reasonably beefy

## Some fluff characters
- probably someone who can make summons to keep combat dynaamic
